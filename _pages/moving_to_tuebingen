## Moving to Tübingen 
I have lived outside of Germany for about 15 years. Thus, although I am German it feels like moving to a new country. I will share my experience here and provide Tipps when moving as well as useful links. Please write an [email](mailto:dr.thomas.wolfers@gmail.com) if I miss information that I should include!

I was lucky and found my apartment via contacts at my work. Get the feeling that it often works this way. Thus, reach out to your employer, collegues and people in general for help. When you search don't get too frustrated about the process it is difficult to find something and a bit of luck is required.

### 2) How to calculate your income and what are the living costs?<br>

Living costs in Germany are currently increasing but your purchasing power is quite high in comparison to most other countries. You can find shared housing from ~250-300 Euros per month to flats for yourself of ~70-150 sqm between ~700-1600 Euros per month. The food is good in quality and affordable, as are drinks. I pay about 120-160 Euros for food and drinks per week and I don’t check prices at all but also do not drink much apart from water. I have a vegetarian diet and often buy biological products.
