## Foundations of Mental Health Mapping  
<img align="left" src="https://mhm-lab.github.io/images/foundations_of_mental_health_mapping.png" width="100 px" style="padding: 10px"> It is often unclear what constitutes a disorder and what is healthy or normative, especially if the disorder is a consequence of unwholesome mental states. We explore the foundations of what constitutes health, disorder, or disease and explore questions such as: What is healthy? What is the right reference group to compare disease with? Can we utilize systematic explorations of the mind as tools to understand it? In the long run, this work contributes to the theoretical foundation of mental health mapping, incorporating first and third person perspectives. We work together with philosophers, clinicians and patients who provide insights into clinical practice and inform our science in theoretical and practical ways.

## Structures of Mental Health Mapping
Mental disorders are heritable (passed down through generations in families), comorbid, and heterogenous. They require structures from which they emerge. Sometimes this structure is an impaired biology in a single individual, in other cases the psychodynamics between two individuals, groups or different parts of society. In our lab, we explore the structures that support and hinder mental health. Our work will be guided by questions such as what makes one sibling with a disorder different from another who is healthy? What are the interpersonal factors contributing to mental health in families? When does it make sense to treat a group of individuals instead of the individual patient? What is the role of society and which policies, and treatments are improving our mental health? We work together with scientists, clinicians and social workers using large scale studies that contain necessary data for answering these questions.

## Markers for Mental Health Mapping
The factors underlying mental health or disorder are not well understood and a complex web of biological and non-biological variables interact producing symptoms in any given individual. This is one of the reasons why we have limited insights into the markers linked to illness and we often do not know if a treatment works before it has been tried. Through multimodal approaches we aim to detect hidden factors underlying illness and are guided by questions such as what makes one person different from another when diagnosed with the same disorder? How can we uncover predictive markers for illness? Which data modalities are informative for which disorder or disease process? We work together with scientists and clinicians interested in different disorders and diseases and companies with innovative approaches regarding e.g., the development of sensors.

## Models for Mental Health Mapping 
Most of the research directions described above involve machine learning tools. Therefore, we apply and develop these approaches (e.g., normative modelling) for large scale imaging, electrophysiological, genetic and sensor data. Our methods are adapted to high dimensional data and often very unreliable labels. Our work is guided by question such as how can we utilize machine learning across modalities? What methods are best to parse heterogeneity? Which longitudinal modelling procedures are suited to deal with the properties of the underlying data structures? How can we increase the interpretability of our models and ultimately how can we take machine learning from the lab to clinical practice? We work together with scientists interested in technical method development (e.g., machine learning, statistics, computer science) as well as in establishing best practices in curating complex, large datasets required for our research agenda.

* SUMMARY: In this seminal paper, we showed that with increasing sample size the accuracy of pattern classification approaches for the prediction of mental disorders decreased. This is counterintuitive and in conflict with evidence in other fields that use pattern recognition approaches to predict e.g., image classes, likes cats and dogs. Generally, machine learning algorithms perform better with more training data. Therefore, this finding was very surprising. We could attribute it in parts to the high heterogeneity of mental disorders and a publication bias for better performing but not representative models. This work contributed to a debate on cross-validation failures and provides important evidence for the development of methods to map heterogeneity of mental disorders.

* SUMMARY: We showed the problems of stratification approaches in psychiatry and developed a strategy based on normative modelling that can improve these problems.

* SUMMARY: We mapped the heterogeneity of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder showing an individualized profile of deviations from the norm. These results were very surprising and framed by the media as "Who is the average patient in psychiatry?". The results have been frequently replicated by us and other groups using various algorithms and samples.

* SUMMARY: We mapped the heterogeneity of ADHD at the level of the individual patient, showing that each patient had a distinct profile of deviations from the norm.
