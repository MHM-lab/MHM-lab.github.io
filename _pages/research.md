## Research interests

***Foundations of Mental Health Mapping***
<br>
It is unclear what constitutes a disorder and what is healthy or normative, especially if the disorder is a consequence of unwholesome mental states. Together with philosophers we explore the foundations of what constitutes health, disorder, or disease. We explore questions such as. What is healthy? What is the right reference group to test disease against? Can we utilize systematic explorations of the mind as tools to understand it? In the long run this work forms the theoretical foundation of mental health mapping, incorporating first and third person perspectives on mental health. We work together with philosophers, clinicians and patients who provide insights into clinical practice and inform our science in theoretical and practical ways.

***Structures of Mental Health Mapping***
<br>
Mental disorders run in families and are heritable. Yet, in many studies’ family structures are merely considered as confounds. In our lab we explore family structures as the nexus of illness and not as a confound that hinders or distorts a given statistical estimate. In this way, we aim to shed light on interpersonal factors contributing to mental health and illness in families. Our work will be guided by questions such as what makes one sibling with a disorder different from another who is health? What are the interpersonal factors contributing to mental health and does it make sense to treat the family instead of the individual with a given disorder? We work together with scientists and clinicians interested in research on families with mental illness and work on lage scale studies that contain family structures.

***Markers for Mental Health Mapping***
<br>
The factors underlying our mental health are often poorly understood. We usually do not know if a given medication will work before it has been given and we have limited insights with respect to why one treatment is preferable over another. We can only state with certainty, that many factors play out during development and that those factors contribute to the emergence of mental health problems. Through multimodal approaches (e.g., imaging, electrophysiology, or sensors), we aim to detect hidden factors underlying illness at the level of the individual. We are guided by questions such as what makes one person different from another even if diagnosed with the same disorder? How can we uncover predictive markers for illness? Which data modalities are informative for which disorder or disease process? We work together with scientists and clinicians interested in different disorders and diseases (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, ADHD, Autism(s)) as well as scientist and companies with innovative approaches regarding data acquisition (e.g., sensors).

***Models for Mental Health Mapping***
<br>
We are often faced with little information buried under a lot of noise. For individual level predictions classical statistical methods are not suitable. Therefore, we apply and develop machine learning approaches (e.g., normative modeling, deep learning) for large scale imaging, electrophysiological and sensor data. These techniques require the adaptation to high dimensional domain data and often very unreliable labels. We will be guided by question such as how can we utilize machine learning across modalities? What methods are best to parse heterogeneity? Which longitudinal modeling procedures are suited to deal the given properties of the underlying data structures? How can we increase the interpretability of our models and ultimately how can we take machine learning from the lab into clinical practice? We work together with scientist who are interested in machine learning and statistics.

* SUMMARY: In this seminal paper, we showed that with increasing sample size the accuracy of pattern classification approaches for the prediction of mental disorders decreased. This is counterintuitive and in conflict with evidence in other fields that use pattern recognition approaches to predict e.g., image classes, likes cats and dogs. Generally, machine learning algorithms perform better with more training data. Therefore, this finding was very surprising. We could attribute it in parts to the high heterogeneity of mental disorders and a publication bias for better performing but not representative models. This work contributed to a debate on cross-validation failures and provides important evidence for the development of methods to map heterogeneity of mental disorders.

* SUMMARY: We showed the problems of stratification approaches in psychiatry and developed a strategy based on normative modelling that can improve these problems.

* SUMMARY: We mapped the heterogeneity of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder showing an individualized profile of deviations from the norm. These results were very surprising and framed by the media as "Who is the average patient in psychiatry?". The results have been frequently replicated by us and other groups using various algorithms and samples.

* SUMMARY: We mapped the heterogeneity of ADHD at the level of the individual patient, showing that each patient had a distinct profile of deviations from the norm.

* SUMMARY: We charted normative models at high spatial precision for samples that are larger than 50k individuals.
