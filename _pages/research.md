## Foundations of Mental Health Mapping  
<img align="left" src="https://mhm-lab.github.io/images/foundations_of_mental_health_mapping.png" width="200 px" style="padding: 10px"> What constitutes a disorder and what is healthy or normative, especially if the disorder is a consequence of unwholesome mental states, can be unclear. We explore the foundations of what constitutes health, disorder, or disease and explore questions such as: What is healthy? What is the right reference group to compare disease with? Can we utilize systematic explorations of the mind as tools to understand it? In the long run, this work contributes to the theoretical foundation of mental health mapping, incorporating first and third person perspectives. We work together with philosophers, clinicians and patients who provide insights into clinical practice and inform our science in theoretical and practical ways.

## Structures of Mental Health Mapping
<img align="left" src="https://mhm-lab.github.io/images/structures_of_mental_health_mapping.png" width="200 px" style="padding: 10px"> Mental disorders are heritable (passed down through generations in families), comorbid, and heterogenous. Sometimes an impaired biology in a single individual is the structure underlying illness, in other cases the psychodynamics between individuals, groups or different parts of society as well as environmental stressors. We are guided by questions such as what makes one sibling with a disorder different from another who is healthy? What are the interpersonal factors contributing to mental health in families? When does it make sense to treat a group of individuals instead of the individual patient? What is the role of society and which policies, and treatments are improving our mental health? We work on large scale studies that contain necessary data for answering these questions and collaborate with scientists and clinicians.

## Markers for Mental Health Mapping
<img align="left" src="https://mhm-lab.github.io/images/markers_for_mental_health_mapping.png" width="200 px" style="padding: 10px"> The factors underlying mental health or disorder are not well understood and a complex web of biological and non-biological variables interact producing symptoms in any given individual. This is one of the reasons why we have limited insights into the markers linked to illness. Through multimodal approaches we aim to detect hidden factors underlying illness and are guided by questions such as what makes one person different from another when diagnosed with the same disorder? How can we uncover predictive markers for illness? Which data modalities are informative for which disorder or disease process? We work together with scientists and clinicians interested in different disorders and diseases.

## Models for Mental Health Mapping 
<img align="left" src="https://mhm-lab.github.io/images/models_for_mental_ health_mapping.png" width="200 px" style="padding: 10px"> Most of the research directions described above involve machine learning tools. Therefore, we apply and develop these approaches for large scale imaging, electrophysiological, genetic, sensor, cognitive and behavioural data. Our methods are adapted to high dimensional data and often very unreliable labels. Our work is guided by questions such as how can we utilize machine learning across modalities? What methods are best to parse heterogeneity? Which longitudinal modelling procedures are suited to deal with the properties of the underlying data structures? How can we increase the interpretability of our models and ultimately how can we take machine learning from the lab to clinical practice? We work together with scientists working on innovative data acquisition methods and are interested in method development (e.g., machine learning, statistics) as well as in establishing best practices in curating complex, large datasets required for our research agenda.

## Selected Publications

**2025** MedSAMix: A Training-Free Model Merging Approach for Medical Image Segmentation. ***under review***. [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11032)
* SUMMARY: Universal medical segmentation models promise broad utility but struggle with scarce, heterogeneous data. We present MedSAMix, a training-free method that automatically merges generalist (SAM) and specialist (MedSAM) models for optimal performance. Across 25 tasks, MedSAMix reduces bias and improves both generalization and domain-specific accuracy by up to 6.7%.
  
**2025** Hierarchical Characterization of Brain Dynamics via State Space-based Vector Quantization. ***MICCAI***. [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22952)
* SUMMARY: We introduce a Hierarchical State-space Tokenization network (HST), which breaks brain activity into stable “tokens,” like building blocks, and tracks how the brain moves between them. Tested on two independent datasets our method captures these dynamics more clearly than existing approaches and shows promise for understanding dynamic brain functions in health and disease.

**2025** A 10-year longitudinal study of brain cortical thickness in people with first-episode psychosis using normative models. ***Schizophrenia Bulletin***. [link](https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbae107)
* SUMMARY: We demonstrate that, in some cases, brain abnormalities associated with schizophrenia show signs of normalization over time. Additionally, we underscore the critical importance of modeling site-specific variability to ensure accurate inference. This is especially relevant in longitudinal neuroimaging studies, where changes in scanning protocols and equipment over time can introduce significant confounds if not properly accounted for.

**2024** Computational psychiatry and the evolving concept of a mental disorder. ***Synthese***. [link](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-024-04741-6)
* SUMMARY: We explore the pursuit of a coherent framework for research and treatment in psychiatry, driven by growing dissatisfaction with traditional concepts of mental disorders. This exploration incorporates various computational paradigms, including normative modeling, network theory, and learning-theoretic approaches. Each of these paradigms offers unique methodologies and visions for reconceptualizing mental disorders. In this discussion, we examine their similarities, differences, and potential conceptual conflicts.

* SUMMARY: We trained a deep neural network on N > 50k individuals to predict the aging brain. We transferred this model to make clinical predictions. We show that scale matters also in deep machine learning based imaging. Our model has been benchmarked by another group to be the-state-of-the-art brain age model.

**2018** Mapping the heterogeneous phenotype of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder using normative models. ***JAMA psychiatry***. [link](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.2467)
* SUMMARY: We mapped the heterogeneity of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder showing an individualized profile of deviations from the normative structural brain. These results were very surprising and framed by the media as "Who is the average patient in psychiatry?". The results have been frequently replicated by us and other groups using various data-modalities, algorithms and samples.

**2015** From estimating activation locality to predicting disorder: a review of pattern recognition for neuroimaging-based psychiatric diagnostics. **Neuroscience & Biobehavioural Reviews**. [link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2015.08.001) 
* SUMMARY: In this paper, we showed that with increasing sample size the accuracy of pattern classification approaches for the prediction of mental disorders decreased. This is counterintuitive and in conflict with evidence in other fields that use pattern recognition approaches to predict e.g., image classes, likes cats and dogs. Generally, supervised machine learning algorithms tend to perform better with more training data. Therefore, this finding was very surprising. We could attribute it in parts to the high heterogeneity of mental disorders and a publication bias for better performing but not representative models. This work contributed to a debate on cross-validation failures and provides important evidence for the development of methods to map heterogeneity of mental disorders.
