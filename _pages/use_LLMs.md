title: "Use of LLMs"
---

Large Language Models (LLMs) can be useful for structuring ideas, drafting text, or refining language. At the same time, they raise important questions of **academic integrity, transparency, and accountability**.  
<br>
We take a balanced view: LLMs can improve performance and help democratize scienceâ€”for example, by reducing barriers for researchers whose first language is not English. They also help manage increasing demands on researchers; major conferences now receive 20,000+ submissions, making review workloads extremely high. Still, all **scientific content must remain human-authored**, and in our lab, LLMs are limited to editing and support roles.  
<br>
Below are the concrete rules I apply to myself and encourage my students and employees to follow as well:  

---

## 1. Students & PhD Students  

- **Permitted**: Brainstorming, outlining, and language polishing.<br>
- **Not permitted**: Submitting AI-generated text, code, or analysis as original work. All scientific contributions must be your own.<br>
- **Compliance**: Students must follow the regulations of their program or graduate school, share these with the PI/supervisor, and ensure they are respected. <br>

---

## 2. Publications  

- **Permitted**: Language refinement (grammar, style, conciseness).<br>
- **Accountability**: Authors remain fully responsible for accuracy, originality, and ethical standards. Only verified content may be published.<br>
- **Compliance**: LLM use must follow (a) graduate school rules if the work is part of a thesis, and (b) journal policies. Where required, LLM use should be declared.<br>

## 3. Ad-hoc Reviews  

- **Permitted**: Language editing of reviews.<br>
- **Not permitted**: Sharing unpublished manuscripts with external tools or using AI to generate judgments.<br> 
- **Compliance**: Review practices must follow the rules of the respective journal or conference, as (hopefully) provided during the review invitation.<br>
<br>
This determinantion maybe subject to changes as the field and respective regulations evolve further.
