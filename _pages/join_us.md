We are recruiting an outstanding Postdoctoral Researcher to join our team in Jena. The ideal candidate has strong experience in neuroscience and machine learning, with a genuine interest in the research directions of our group. The position offers the opportunity to develop your own research line, work toward independence, and receive dedicated time and support to apply for personal funding, while also contributing to supervision within the team. We are seeking exceptional candidates—comparable to the high-caliber postdocs already in our group—who are committed to a long-term career in science. Applicants should be close to completing their PhD or within two years of graduation, ready to take the next step toward scientific independence. The position is funded by the Carl Zeiss Foundation, initially for one year with the possibility of extension up to five years (and beyond if appropriate). Applications will be considered until the position is filled; please email Thomas Wolfers by [email](mailto:dr.thomas.wolfers@gmail.com) with your CV, a letter of motivation, and your best first-author publication attached. The position offers independence so only candidates, who can show that to some extend will be considered.
