## ## Moving to Germany
For about the last two decades, I have lived outside of Germant. Thus, although I am German to some extend it feels like moving to a new country. I will share my experience here and provide Tipps when moving as well as important links. Please write an [email](mailto:dr.thomas.wolfers@gmail.com) if I miss information that I should include! This section will be updated regularly during my moving process.

Useful links:<br>
[FacebookGroup](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Tuebingen.Immo) > not very helpful in my case at least<br>
[WG-Gesucht](https://www.wg-gesucht.de) > helpful but did not get many responses<br>

[schoener_wohnen](https://lists.schokokeks.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/schoener-wohnen) > helpful email-list but did not find anything for me there<br>
I was lucky and found my apartment via contacts at my work. Get the feeling that it often works this way. Thus reach out to people, univeristy and collegues for help. When you search don't get too frustrated about the process it is difficult to find something and a bit of luck is required.
