<br> We are recruiting an outstanding Postdoctoral Researcher to join our team in Jena, Germany. The ideal candidate has strong experience in neuroscience and machine learning, with a genuine interest in the research directions of our group. The position offers the opportunity to develop your own research line aligned with the team, working toward scientific independence, and receive dedicated time and support to apply for personal funding, while also contributing to supervision within the team. We are seeking exceptional candidates who are committed to a long-term career in science. Applicants should be close to completing their PhD or within two years of graduation, ready to take the next step. The position is funded by the Carl Zeiss Foundation, initially for one year with the possibility of extension up to five years (and beyond if appropriate and in your interest). Applications will be considered until the position is filled; please [email Thomas Wolfers](mailto:dr.thomas.wolfers@gmail.com) with your CV, a letter of motivation, and your best first-author publication attached. The position offers considerable independence so only candidates, who can show that (to some extend) will be considered. 

<br>We currently have three postdocs, two of whom secured personal funding after joining. I am committed to supporting you in achieving your goals.<br>
