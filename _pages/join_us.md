All currently available positions are listed in this section. We are located in the Department of Psychiatry (Calwerstraße 14) @ The University of Tübingen (Room 2.327). If you like to meet up in person that is (usually) possible on Thursdays between 4-5pm. Please get in touch via email beforehand. When you visit be mindful that we are in a clinic and you might come across potentially vulnerable groups, thus follow all health related regulations. You can get in touch by email if you like to write a research proposal for individual funding (e.g., Marie Curie) or if you have any other questions. You can send your application or inquiry to Thomas Wolfers by [email](mailto:dr.thomas.wolfers@gmail.com).
