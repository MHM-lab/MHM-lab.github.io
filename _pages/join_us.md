### I. 3-5 year Postdoc position in Tübingen (Germany) 
You will be placed on the German scale TV-L 13 at 100%, which is a very good salary compared internationally for Postdocs especially if you factor in purchasing power. The duration of your contract will be 3-5 years, which is dependent on the continuation of funding. If you have a background (PhD) in machine learning, computer-science, neuroscience, physics, or related field and expertise in python, R, and/or another programming language(s) with experience in brain imaging (MRI, EEG, etc.), you are the ideal candidate! However, also send your CV, letter of motivation and contacts of two mentors if you do not reach the ideal entirely. The ideal is a high bar and I have yet to meet a person jumping over it. Thus, if this position and our lab speaks to you, don’t hesitate to apply, or get in touch if you have any questions. Looking forward to your application and maybe you will be the new member of our team in Tübingen.
