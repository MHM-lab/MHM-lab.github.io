title: "Moving to Jena"
---

***Jena in Germany*** is a city of about 110,000 people, located close to Leipzig (~1h by train) and Berlin (~2.5h by train). This allows you to enjoy the cultural and social opportunities of larger cities while living in a quieter environment with fewer daily distractions.  

Jena has a rich scientific and cultural heritage. It is the birthplace of **the planetarium** and of **modern optics** through Carl Zeiss. Less well known is that the **electroencephalogram (EEG)** was invented here by Hans Berger - a problematic figure during the Nazi regime, reminding us that scientific achievement does not ensure moral integrity. Still, his work on functional brain recordings made Jena a pioneer in **human brain mapping** and the study of the human mind.

The University of Jena has been home to many [historical figures](https://www.uni-jena.de/en/109868/famous-university-teachers-and-students-from-the-history-of-the-university-of-jena-selection), including the first [female professor at a German university](https://www.uni-jena.de/en/213543/the-first-female-professor-at-a-german-university). The city has ties to the [Humboldts](https://communities.springernature.com/posts/humboldt-s-living-legacy-in-jena-germany), and his intellectual and cultural spirit is still felt today. Nearby Weimar, the birthplace of Germany’s first democracy, and [Buchenwald](https://www.buchenwald.de/en/geschichte/chronologie/konzentrationslager), a stark reminder of its collapse and what followed, provide important historical lessons that remain relevant.  

In essence, Jena is a place where the **discovery of the stars** (through optics) and the **study of the brain** (through the electroencephalogram) first emerged and intersected. At this crossroads, one might say, magic unfolds—as the brain, through mysterious processes, creates experience, subjectivity, and ultimately the capacity to witness the universe itself. To me, that remains both awe-inspiring and profoundly fascinating.

Below you will find practical information about moving to **Jena** and Germany.

## 1) How is the research environment in Jena?

**Useful links**  
1. [University of Jena: Research Environment](https://www.jenaversum.de/jenaversum/research/?lang=en)  
2. [JenaWirtschaft: Research strengths](https://www.jenawirtschaft.de/en/location/research/)  

**Overview**  
Jena offers an internationally recognized research environment with strengths in **optics and photonics, life and health sciences, biodiversity, materials and energy, and climate research**.  

The Friedrich Schiller University Jena holds the [HR Excellence in Research Award](https://www.uni-jena.de/en/243628/hr-excellence-in-research-award). Two Clusters of Excellence further strengthen the research environment.  

The University of Jena is a site of the **German Center for Mental Health**. My professorship bridges the University and the University Hospital, and I hold a PI position in the Center.  

In addition to the University, several **Max Planck Institutes** and other non-university research centers contribute to a highly interdisciplinary ecosystem.  

The city’s location facilitates strong collaborations: Leipzig (~1h), Dresden (~3h), and Berlin (~2.5h) are all within reach.  

Carl Zeiss remains omnipresent. For instance the largest [Carl Zeiss research campus worldwide](https://www.zeiss.de/corporate/ueber-zeiss/gegenwart/daten-fakten/zeiss-standorte/jena.html) is currently being built. As Carl Zeiss Professor, I aim to foster strong collaborations with the Carl Zeiss Foundation & Company, especially on relevant topics in machine learning.

## 2) Getting started in Jena

Compared to other cities we have lived in, it was relatively easy to settle here. Housing can be competitive but manageable, and the daycare infrastructure is excellent. Our children enjoy attending *Kita* until late afternoon, which makes balancing work and family life much easier.  

Jena is a lively city that actively supports its residents. For example, we managed all city-related paperwork **online**, received an appointment the same day, and completed everything within three hours - an experience almost unheard of in Germany.  

**Useful links**

- [Work-in-Jena Guide](https://www.work-in-jena.de/en/living-in-jena/)  

**First steps after arrival**  
- Register your residence (*Anmeldung*) at the local authority.  
- Obtain health insurance (mandatory in Germany).  
- Open a German bank account.  
- Contact the university’s International Office for assistance with visa, residence permits, and integration.

## 3) What can you do in and around Jena?

**Useful links**  
- [Kulturarena Festival](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulturarena)  
- [Zeiss Planetarium Jena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeiss-Planetarium_Jena)  

**Highlights**  
Jena combines a strong academic atmosphere with a vibrant cultural life. The annual **Kulturarena** brings international music and theater to the city. The **Zeiss Planetarium**, the world’s oldest, is still in operation.  

Nature is never far away: the Saale valley and Thuringian Forest offer excellent hiking, cycling, and outdoor opportunities. Within the city, cafés, student clubs, and local bars create a welcoming social environment.

## 4) How to find an apartment in Jena?

**Options**  
- Student housing via Studierendenwerk Thüringen (approx. €200–350/month).  
- Shared apartments (*WG*) and private rentals via **WG-Gesucht** or local Facebook groups.  
- Local newspapers and university message boards.  

**Note**: Many private flats in Germany are rented **unfurnished**, sometimes without kitchens.  

**Tip**: The market is competitive. Apply early and seek help from colleagues or university networks.

## 5) How German is it, and how much German do you need?

Academic life in Jena is highly international, and English is widely spoken in research contexts. However, daily life and bureaucracy are primarily in German.  

Learning German is recommended for smoother integration into social life, though not required for work in the laboratory. Jena has a strong international community, and nearby Leipzig and Berlin offer even larger international networks. The University Language Centre provides language courses for researchers and students.

## 6) How to calculate your income and what are the living costs?

**Useful link**  
- [Living costs in Jena](https://livingcost.org/cost) > As someone who values data-driven decisions, I find this tool very useful. It provides a reasonable picture of life in a place. What really matters are median living costs and median salaries, since medians aren’t distorted by a few extremely high incomes (unfortunatly the tool only offers averages but a good approximation non-the-less). In my view, a city with high living standards for the many -not just the few- offers the best quality of life. By that measure, Jena is exceptional: living costs are roughly half those in cities like Munich or Tübingen, while average salaries are comparable or even higher (see tool above). Add reliable daycare, strong social services, healthcare, efficient local government, and affordable meeting places that bring people together (e.g. libaries that cater to all the young & old, differences in cultures & background), and you get a city that minimizes disparity and polarization. A city or town is, in many ways, like an organism-thriving when it has a healthy mix of people and functions. That’s why Jena stands out in both Germany and Thuringia, and why it’s especially attractive for young professionals and families.

**Estimates**  
- This is a useful TV-L [calculator](https://oeffentlicher-dienst.info/c/t/rechner/tv-l/west?id=tv-l-2025).
- Student residence: €200–350/month  
- Private flat: €700–1,000+ depending on size and location  
- University estimate: €750–900/month total for students (housing, food, transport, insurance, leisure)  

Groceries are affordable, and public transport is efficient.  
That said, housing prices may rise in the coming years as the Carl Zeiss Campus expands and the University attracts more researchers.

## 7) Social support systems

Germany has extensive social protection, including health insurance, unemployment insurance, pensions, and public healthcare. All that comes with your employment and is automatically taken care of. The University also offers counselling and integration services for international researchers and students.  

---

## 8) Family and child support

**Useful links**  
- [Work-in-Jena: Family Support](https://www.work-in-jena.de/en/living-in-jena/family/)  
- [City of Jena: Day-care fees and parental fee calculation](https://service.jena.de/en/day-care-fees-and-parental-fee-calculation)  

**Overview**  
- Parental leave: up to 14 months (shared between parents) at ~60% of last income.  
- Kindergarten and childcare: high quality and affordable. We got three offers from different palces all were excellent! Our kids love it, large gardens and very nice daycare workforce.
- Public schools are free and of good quality. International schools exist but are rarely necessary.

## 9) Vacation days

Employees in Germany typically receive **25–30 paid vacation days per year**, in addition to public holidays. This allows ample opportunity for travel, leisure, and family activities alongside professional responsibilities.
