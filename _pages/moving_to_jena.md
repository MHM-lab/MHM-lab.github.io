title: "Moving to Jena"
---

***Jena in Germany*** is a city of about 110,000 people, located close to Leipzig (~1h by train) and Berlin (~2.5h by train). This allows you to enjoy the cultural and social opportunities of larger cities while living in a quieter environment with fewer daily distractions.  

Jena has a rich scientific and cultural heritage. It is the birthplace of **the planetarium** and of **modern optics** through Carl Zeiss. Less well known is that the **electroencephalogram (EEG)** was invented here by Hans Berger - a problematic figure during the Nazi regime, reminding us that scientific achievement does not ensure moral integrity. Still, his work on functional brain recordings made Jena a pioneer in **human brain mapping** and the study of the human mind.

The University of Jena has been home to many [historical figures](https://www.uni-jena.de/en/109868/famous-university-teachers-and-students-from-the-history-of-the-university-of-jena-selection), including the first [female professor at a German university](https://www.uni-jena.de/en/213543/the-first-female-professor-at-a-german-university). The city has ties to [Humboldt, Schiller, Goethe](https://communities.springernature.com/posts/humboldt-s-living-legacy-in-jena-germany), and their intellectual and cultural spirit is still felt today. Nearby Weimar, the birthplace of Germany’s first democracy, and [Buchenwald](https://www.buchenwald.de/en/geschichte/chronologie/konzentrationslager), a stark reminder of its collapse and what followed, provide important historical lessons that remain relevant.  

In essence, Jena is a place where the **discovery of the stars** (through optics) and the **study of the brain** (through EEG) first emerged and intersected. At this crossroads, one might say, magic unfolds - as the brain, through mysterious processes, creates experience, subjectivity, and ultimately the capacity to witness the universe itself. To me, that remains both awe-inspiring and profoundly fascinating.

Below you will find practical information about moving to **Jena** and Germany.

Several **Max Planck Institutes**, **Leibniz institutes**, and **Fraunhofer institutes** contribute to an interdisciplinary ecosystem.  

Carl Zeiss remains omnipresent.

As Carl Zeiss Professor, I aim to foster strong collaborations with the Carl Zeiss Foundation & Company, especially on relevant topics in machine learning.

## 6) How to calculate your income and what are the living costs?

**Estimates**  
Living costs in Jena for a data-driven overview. What matters most are living costs and median salaries, which reflect conditions for the many rather than a few top earners. By this measure, Jena stands out: costs are roughly half those in Munich or Tübingen, while salaries are comparable or higher. Add reliable daycare, strong social services, healthcare, efficient local government, and affordable public spaces, and you get a city that thrives on balance — making it especially attractive for young professionals and families.
