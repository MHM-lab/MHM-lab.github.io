# Moving to Jena (Germany)
<br>
<br>
Jena is a city of about 110,000 people, located close to Leipzig (~1h by train, also called “Hypezig” or the “new Berlin” (10 years ago) and Berlin (~2h by train). This means you can enjoy all the cultural and social opportunities of larger cities while living in a quieter environment with fewer daily distractions.  
<br>
<br>
Jena has a rich scientific and cultural heritage. It is the birthplace of the **planetarium** (the world’s first was built here) and of modern **optics** through Carl Zeiss. Fewer people know that the **EEG** was invented in Jena by Hans Berger, whos statue is in fromnt of the local Psychiatry department. In this sense, Jena played a pioneering role in **human brain mapping** and the functional investigation of the human mind.  
<br>
<br>
Historically, the University of Jena was very influential and a lot of historcial figures taught and lived here. For instance, Karl Marx lived and taught here. His mother was born in Nijmegen, where I began my PhD journey. Reading *Capital in the Twenty-First Century* (2014) during my PhD deeply shaped my thinking about the redistribution of capital. A theme that is only becoming more urgent in the age of AI and automation, for which we have no answers yet. 
<br>
<br>
The city also has strong ties to **Humboldt**, and its intellectual and cultural spirit is still felt today. Nearby Weimar, the birthplace of Germany’s first democracy, and Buchenwald, a stark reminder of its collapse and what followed, provide important historical lessons that remain relevant.  
<br>
<br>
In essence, Jena is a place where **the discovery of the stars** (via Zeiss optics) and **the study of the brain and consciousness** (via Berger’s EEG) intersect. For our laboratory, Jena is therefore an inspiring new home.  
<br>
<br>
This page provides practical information about moving to **Jena** and Germany.

## 1) How is the research environment in Jena?

**Useful links**

2. [JenaWirtschaft: Research strengths](https://www.jenawirtschaft.de/en/location/research/)  
<br>
<br>
**Overview**  
Jena offers an internationally recognized research environment with strengths in **optics and photonics, life and health sciences, biodiversity, materials and energy, and climate research**.  
<br>
<br>
The Friedrich Schiller University Jena holds the *HR Excellence in Research Award*. Two Clusters of Excellence further strengthen the research environment.  
<br>
<br>
The University of Jena is a site of the **German Center for Mental Health**. My professorship bridges the University and the University Hospital, and I hold a PI position in the Center.  
<br>
<br>
In addition to the University, several **Max Planck Institutes** and other non-university research centers contribute to a highly interdisciplinary ecosystem.  
<br>
<br>
The city’s location facilitates strong collaborations: Leipzig (~1h), Dresden (~2h), and Berlin (~2h) are all within reach.  
<br>
<br>
Carl Zeiss remains omnipresent. The **largest Carl Zeiss research campus worldwide** is currently being built in Jena. As Carl Zeiss Professor, I aim to foster strong collaborations, especially in machine learning.  
<br>

## 2) Getting started in Jena
<br>
<br>
Compared to other cities we have lived in, it was relatively easy to settle here. Housing can be competitive but manageable, and the daycare infrastructure is excellent. Our children enjoy attending *Kita* until late afternoon, which makes balancing work and family life much easier.  
<br>
<br>
Jena is a lively city that actively supports its residents. For example, we managed all city-related paperwork **online**, received an appointment the same day, and completed everything within three hours — an experience almost unheard of in Germany.

<br>
<br>
Nature is never far away: the Saale valley and Thuringian Forest offer excellent hiking, cycling, and outdoor opportunities. Within the city, cafés, student clubs, and local bars create a welcoming social environment.

## 4) How to find an apartment in Jena?
<br>
<br>
**Options**  
- Student housing via Studierendenwerk Thüringen (approx. €200–350/month).  
- Shared apartments (*WG*) and private rentals via **WG-Gesucht** or local Facebook groups.  
- Local newspapers and university message boards.  
<br>
<br>

## 5) How German is it, and how much German do you need?
<br>
<br>
Academic life in Jena is highly international, and English is widely spoken in research contexts.  
However, daily life and bureaucracy are primarily in German.  
<br>
<br>
Learning German is strongly recommended for smoother integration and participation in social life, though not strictly necessary for professional work. The University Language Centre offers courses for international researchers and students.  
<br>

## 6) How to calculate your income and what are the living costs?
<br>
<br>
**Useful link**  
- [Living costs in Jena](https://livingcost.org/cost)  
<br>
<br>
Compared with cities such as Munich or Tübingen, living costs in Jena are about **half**, while academic salaries (TV-L) remain the same. This makes Jena attractive for young professionals and families.  
<br>
<br>

**Estimates**  
- Student residence: €200–350/month  
- Private flat: €700–1,000+ depending on size and location  
- University estimate: €750–900/month total for students (housing, food, transport, insurance, leisure)  
<br>
<br>
Groceries are affordable, and public transport is efficient.  
That said, housing prices may rise in the coming years as the Carl Zeiss Campus expands and the University attracts more researchers.  
<br>
<br>

## 7) Social support systems
<br>
<br>
Germany has extensive social protection, including health insurance, unemployment insurance, pensions, and public healthcare.  
The University also offers counselling and integration services for international researchers and students.  
<br>

- Parental leave: up to 14 months (shared between parents) at ~60% of last income.  
- Kindergarten and childcare: high quality and affordable, though places are limited. Early application is essential.  
- Public schools are free and of good quality. International schools exist but are rarely necessary.

## 9) Vacation days
<br>
<br>
Employees in Germany typically receive **25–30 paid vacation days per year**, in addition to public holidays.  
This allows ample opportunity for travel, leisure, and family activities alongside professional responsibilities.
