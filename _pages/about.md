Our species explored all continents and the deepest oceans on Earth. We mapped and even travelled space around our planet. We got a better understanding of the principles and formulas by which the universe operates. Through this process we developed increasingly complex models of our environment, that allow for meaningful predictions of the future and our place in it. The enormous scientific efforts to understand what surrounds us are not matched by those that describe what lies within us.

In the laboratory for ***Mental Health Mapping*** (PI: Thomas Wolfers) we aim to make a difference for individuals with complex health challenges by developing approaches that zoom in on the individual instead of the disorder or disease as category. More concretely, we discover hidden factors contributing to mental health through developing and applying machine learning methods to high dimensional and multimodal datasets. In this way, we improve current models of mental health. We work together with patients and clinicians to build bridges between clinical practice and basic research in neuroscience and machine learning.
