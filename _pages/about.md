In the laboratory for Mental Health Mapping (PI: Thomas Wolfers) we aim to make a difference for people with complex health challenges. We think that the individualâ€™s trajectory through life is a consequence of a complex developmental process, that involves biological, social, and environmental factors. In our research we use large scale multimodal datasets in combination with machine learning to map this complex process. We collaborate with patients and clinicians building bridges between clinical practice and basic research in neuroscience and machine learning, with the ultimate objective to translate our work into clinical practice.
