Science is more than my profession, I want to bring tangible progress to the life of people with a mental disorder. Through a focus on individuals as opposed to the disorder as a category, I hope to reduce stigmatization and in the long run improve our capacity to treat mechanisms causing suffering. In doing so I apply and develop machine learning methods.
