Maps increase our understanding of the world. As a species we map the space that surrounds our planet, explore the deepest oceans to get a better understanding of its secrets and define the principles and formulars by which our planet operates. Through this process we develop increasingly complex models of our environment, helping us to make meaningful predictions about relevant possible futures and our place in it. The enormous scientific explorations to understand what surrounds us are not (yet) matched by scientific explorations to describe what is within us.

In the laboratory for ***Mental Health Mapping*** (PI: Dr. Thomas Wolfers) we aim to make a difference for individuals with complex health challenges by developing approaches that zoom in on the individual instead of the disorder or disease as category. More concretely, we discover hidden factors contributing to mental health through developing and applying machine learning methods to high dimensional and multimodal datasets (e.g., imaging, electrophysiology, and sensors). In this way we improve current models of mental health and hope to reduce stigmatization through a focus on the individual. In the long run we aim to improve our capacity to treat the underlying factors causing suffering. We work together with patients and clinicians to achieve our goals and build bridges between clinical practice and basic research in neuroscience and machine learning.
