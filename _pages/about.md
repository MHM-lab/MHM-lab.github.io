What makes us unique? How do our intrinsic traits bias our perceptions and judgments, and how is this reflected in patterns of brain activity? Why might different people arrive at different interpretations of the same experience? Our research combines behavioral, neuroimaging and computational techniques to study individual differences in cognition, especially under rich, dynamic, "naturalistic" stimulation such as watching movies or listening to stories. One ultimate goal of this work is to develop better diagnostic and prognostic tools for mental illness, by understanding which individuals are most at risk and why.
