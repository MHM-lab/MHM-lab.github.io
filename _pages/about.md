In this international workshop on machine learning in clinical neuroimaging (MLCN). Here, you find all information regaring our next and previous workshops. We bring together top researchers in both machine learning, neuroscience and tech-savvy clinicians to address two main challenges: i) development of methodological approaches for analyzing complex neuroimaging data and ii) filling the translational gap in applying existing machine learning methods in clinical practice. You can find the MLCN proceedings of the last years [here](https://link.springer.com/conference/mlcn). 

We are looking forward to your contributions to MLCN 2023. This years workshop will be hybrid, thus you can participate in Vancouver or from home.
