In this international workshop on machine learning in clinical neuroimaging. We bring together top researchers in both machine learning, neuroscience and tech-savvy clinicians to address two main challenges: i) development of methodological approaches for analyzing complex neuroimaging data (machine learning track) and ii) filling the translational gap in applying existing machine learning methods in clinical practices (clinical neuroimaging track).
