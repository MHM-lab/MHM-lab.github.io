The mind in health and disorder is little understood. While we have achieved immense success exploring, describing, and even predicting what surrounds us we do not have a clear view of what lies within us. In the laboratory for Mental Health Mapping (PI: Thomas Wolfers) we aim to make a difference for people with complex health challenges by developing approaches that zoom in on the process underlying illness instead of the disorder or disease as category. We use large and multimodal datasets and machine learning in our work and collaborate with patients and clinicians to build bridges between clinical practice and basic research in neuroscience and machine learning.
