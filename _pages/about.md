In the laboratory for ***Mental Health Mapping*** (PI: [Thomas Wolfers](https://thomaswolfers.github.io)) we aim to make a difference for people with complex health challenges. Each person's trajectory through life is a consequence of a complex developmental process, that involves biological, social, societal, and environmental factors. In our research we use large and diverse datasets in combination with machine learning to map this process. We collaborate with patients and clinicians building bridges between clinical practice and basic research in neuroscience and machine learning, with the ultimate objective to translate our work into clinical practice.

This machine learning-generated speech, based on this homepage, has a pleasant tone but lacks detail precision. Nonetheless, the results are impressive. We advocate for ethical and thoughtful data collection to map the mental health landscape as individuals enter clinical care, allowing for data sharing after consent from digital devices when beneficial for personalized treatment or monitoring. This is a developing area of research with the aim of eventual integration into clinical practice. The scope and implementation will depend on ongoing research, both ours and others. As such, the generated speech should be seen as a potential roadmap, not a definitive guide. We present it here to demonstrate the advancements in machine learning and language manipulation in recent years.
