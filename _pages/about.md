The mind in health and disorder is not well understood. While we have achieved immense success exploring, describing, and even predicting what surrounds us we do not have a clear view of what lies within us. In the laboratory for Mental Health Mapping (PI: Thomas Wolfers) we aim to make a difference for individuals with complex health challenges by developing approaches that zoom in on the individual instead of the disorder or disease as category. More concretely, we discover hidden factors contributing to mental health through developing and applying machine learning methods to high dimensional and multimodal datasets. In this way, we improve current models of mental health. We work together with patients and clinicians to build bridges between clinical practice and basic research in neuroscience and machine learning.
