In this series of talks on Integrative Mental Health we cover a large variety of topics that reflect the current state-of-the-art in mental health research and clinical practice. Usually, we invite outstanding researchers to talk about their work on neuroscience, genetics, machine learning, computational modelling, reinforcement learning, complex systems, advances imaging, brain stimulation and other topics of relevance for mental health research. Sometimes, we invite exceptional clinicians to talk about their work and how it can be informative for science. Occasionally, we interview patients on their experience with mental health challenges. The talks are primarily intended for a scientific and professional audience but people from the public are also welcome!

You can sign up for our [email list](TBD) and watch previous talks (provided the speaker agreed) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClXETK-LMbC4AMu3KXnwJUg). We are looking forward to welcoming you to the talks on Integrative Mental Health.
