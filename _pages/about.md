Welcome to our Laboratory for Mental Health and Machine Learning. We aim to drive innovations that improve the mental and physiological health of people. The lab has two main branches. In the mental health branch, we focus on questions that may improve our knowledge of factors contributing to mental health and health in general. In the machine learning branch, we utilize and develop machine learning methods to improve the analytics of high dimensional data derived from various modalities including imaging, physiology, or sensors. We work together with patients, clinicians, and machine learning experts to achieve our goals and aim to build bridges between clinical practice and machine learning research. In this way we drive innovations that make a positive difference for the individuals with complex health challenges. Instead of focussing on the disorder as category we develop approaches that zoom in on the individual, in this way we aim to reduce stigmatization and in the long run improve our capacity to treat the underlying factors causing suffering.
