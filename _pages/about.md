While science has achieved immense success exploring, describing, and even predicting our environment going as far as our and other galaxies. We must admit that this impressive scientific success is not matched by a clear view of what lies within us. In the laboratory for Mental Health Mapping (PI: Thomas Wolfers) we aim to make a difference for people with complex health challenges by developing approaches that zoom in on the factors underlying illness. We consider mental health and illness as a complex process that is not well captured by categories of disorders and diseases. In our research we use large scale multimodal datasets and machine learning and collaborate with patients and clinicians to build bridges between clinical practice and basic research in neuroscience and machine learning.
