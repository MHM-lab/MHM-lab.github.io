## Welcome!
<br>
<br>
In our work we aim to make a difference for individuals with complex health challenges by developing approaches that zoom in on the individual instead of the disorder or disease as category. In this way we reduce stigmatization and in the long run improve our capacity to treat the underlying factors causing suffering. 
<br>
<br>
The lab has two main branches. In the personalized medicine branch, we focus on understanding hidden factors that contribute to mental and physiological health. In the machine learning branch, we utilize and develop machine learning methods to improve the analytics of high dimensional data collected via various modalities including imaging, electrophysiology, and sensors. We work together with patients and clinicians to achieve our goals and aim to build bridges between clinical practice and basic research in neuroscience and machine learning.
