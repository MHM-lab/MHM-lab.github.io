In this series of talks on ***Integrative Mental Health*** we cover a large variety of topics that reflect the current state-of-the-art in mental health research and clinical practice. Usually, we invite outstanding researchers to talk about their work on neuroscience, genetics, machine learning, computational modelling, reinforcement learning, complex systems, advanced imaging, brain stimulation and other topics of relevance for mental health research. Sometimes, we invite exceptional clinicians to talk about their work and how it can be informative for science. Occasionally, we interview (former) patients on their experience with mental health challenges and how their process can inform science and clinical practice. The talks are primarily intended for a scientific and professional audience but people from the public are also welcome!

We post the next and previous talks on this website and you can watch all talks (provided the speaker agreed) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClXETK-LMbC4AMu3KXnwJUg). You can sign up for our [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=imh.talks%40gmail.com&ctz=Europe%2FBerlin) where we enter all scheduled talks and you can follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/IMHtalks), whatever works best for you. We are looking forward to welcoming you to the talks on Integrative Mental Health.
