As a species we map the space surrounding our planet, explore the deepest oceans to get a better understanding of its secrets and define the principles and formulas by which our planet and the universe operate. Through this process we develop increasingly complex models of our environment, which enable us to make meaningful predictions about possible futures. The enormous scientific efforts to understand what surrounds us are not matched by those that describe what lies within us.

In the laboratory for ***Mental Health Mapping*** (PI: Dr. Thomas Wolfers) we aim to make a difference for individuals with complex health challenges by developing approaches that zoom in on the individual instead of the disorder or disease as category. More concretely, we discover hidden factors contributing to mental health through developing and applying machine learning methods to high dimensional and multimodal datasets (e.g., imaging, electrophysiology, and sensors). In this way we improve current models of mental health and hope to reduce stigmatization through a focus on the individual. We work together with patients and clinicians and built bridges between clinical practice and basic research in neuroscience and machine learning.
