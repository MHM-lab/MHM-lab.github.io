In this series of talks on Integrative Mental Health we cover a large variety of topics that reflect the current state-of-the-art in mental health research and clinical practice. We invite speakers from various disciplines and backgrounds. We cover topics in neuroscience, genetics, machine learning, big data, computational modelling, reinforcement learning, advances imaging methods, brain stimulation, innovative treatments, and other topics of relevance to uncover and improve mental health research and clinical practice. We also invite outstanding clinicians to talk about practical work as well as patients with whom we discuss living with their mental health challenge and how science could improve their lives. The talks are primarily intended for a scientific audience but patients and people from the public, who want to be informed on the scientific discourse are also welcome! The discussions, however, can be detailed and difficult to understand without the right background.
