In this international workshop on machine learning in clinical neuroimaging (MLCN). We bring together top researchers in both machine learning, neuroscience and tech-savvy clinicians to address two main challenges: i) development of methodological approaches for analyzing complex neuroimaging data ***-machine learning track-*** and ii) filling the translational gap in applying existing machine learning methods in clinical practices ***-clinical neuroimaging track-***.

You can find the proceedings of MLCN of the last years [here](https://link.springer.com/conference/mlcn). We are looking forward to your contributions to MLCN 2023 in Vancouver. On this homepage you can find our program for our next workshop and you can follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/MLCNworkshop) to get all our latest updates.
