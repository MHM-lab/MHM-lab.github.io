      In the laboratory for <strong><em>Mental Health Mapping</em></strong> (PI: 
      <a href="https://thomaswolfers.github.io">Thomas Wolfers</a>) we aim to make a difference for people with complex health challenges. 
      Each person's trajectory through life is a consequence of a complex developmental process, that involves biological, social, societal, and environmental factors. 
      In our research we use large and diverse datasets in combination with machine learning to map this process. 
      We collaborate with patients and clinicians building bridges between clinical practice and basic research in neuroscience and machine learning, with the ultimate objective to translate our work into clinical practice. 
      You can follow us on

    introduction to the laboratory for Mental Health Mapping. 
    This machine learning-generated discourse, based on the content of this homepage, has a pleasant tone but lacks detail and precision. 
    Nonetheless, the result is very impressive. We advocate for ethical and thoughtful data collection to map the (mental) health landscape as individuals enter clinical care, allowing for data sharing from digital devices, with consent, when beneficial for personalized treatment or monitoring. 
    Itâ€™s important to emphasize that this is a developing area of research aimed at eventual integration into clinical practice and involves a community of national and international researchers.
