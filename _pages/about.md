Welcome to our Laboratory for Personalized Medicine & Machine Learning. We aim to drive innovations that improve mental and physiological health of people. The lab has two main branches. In the personalized medicine branch, we focus on understanding hidden factors that contribute to mental health and health in general. In the machine learning branch, we utilize and develop machine learning methods to improve the analytics of high dimensional data collected via various modalities including imaging, physiology, and sensors. We work together with patients and clinicians to achieve our goals and aim to build bridges between clinical practice and machine learning research. We drive innovations that make a difference for individuals with complex health challenges by developing approaches that zoom in on the individual instead of the disorder or disease as category. In this way we aim to reduce stigmatization and in the long run improve our capacity to treat the underlying factors causing suffering.
