Welcome to our Laboratory for Mental Health and Machine Learning. We aim to drive innovations that improve mental and physiological health of people. The lab has two main branches. In the mental health branch, we focus on understanding the factors that contribute to mental health and health in general. In the machine learning branch, we utilize and develop machine learning methods to improve the analytics of high dimensional data collected via various modalities including imaging, physiology, and sensors. We work together with patients and clinicians to achieve our goals and aim to build bridges between clinical practice and machine learning research. In this way we drive innovations that make a difference for individuals with complex health challenges. Instead of focussing on the disorder as category we develop approaches that zoom in on the individual. In this way we aim to reduce stigmatization and in the long run improve our capacity to treat the underlying factors causing suffering.
