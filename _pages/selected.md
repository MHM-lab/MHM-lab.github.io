**2025** Deep Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Brain Imaging: Large-Scale Benchmarking and Bias Analysis. ***under review***. [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01534)
* SUMMARY: We created a large, multi-center benchmark for deep unsupervised anomaly detection in brain imaging based on methods developed for imaging and industry, using about 3.000 healthy scans and more than 400.000 slices for training. Our systematic evaluation across scanners, lesion types, and demographics reveals substantial performance variability and highlights key methodological limitations that future algorithms must overcome.
  
**2025** MedSAMix: A Training-Free Model Merging Approach for Medical Image Segmentation. ***AAAI - Main  Track***. [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11032)
* SUMMARY: Universal medical segmentation models promise broad utility but struggle with scarce, heterogeneous data. We present MedSAMix, a training-free method that automatically merges generalist (SAM) and specialist (MedSAM) models for optimal performance. Across 25 tasks, MedSAMix reduces bias and improves both generalization and domain-specific accuracy by up to 6.7%.
  
**2025** Hierarchical Characterization of Brain Dynamics via State Space-based Vector Quantization. ***MICCAI - Main Track***. [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22952)
* SUMMARY: We introduce a Hierarchical State-space Tokenization network (HST), which breaks brain activity into stable “tokens,” like building blocks, and tracks how the brain moves between them. Tested on two independent datasets our method captures these dynamics more clearly than existing approaches and shows promise for understanding dynamic brain functions in health and disease.

**2025** Return of the GEDAI: Unsupervised EEG Denoising based on Leadfield Filtering. ***under review***. [link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.04.680449v1)
* SUMMARY: EEG denoising is hindered by physiological and environmental artifacts that limit signal fidelity. We introduce GEDAI (Generalized Eigenvalue De-Artifacting Instrument), a leadfield-based method that removes artifacts diverging from the theoretical EEG forward model. GEDAI cleans corrupted data without references, corrects bad channels and epochs in one step, and separates brain from noise using the SENSAI index. Across simulations and real data with strong EOG, EMG, and noise contamination, it outperformed PCA- and ICA-based methods (ASR, ICLabel, MARA), boosting ERP classification and brain fingerprinting. Fast, autonomous, and robust it is ideal for clinical, mobile, and dry-electrode EEG, MEG, and real-time BCIs.

**2025** A 10-year longitudinal study of brain cortical thickness in people with first-episode psychosis using normative models. ***Schizophrenia Bulletin***. [link](https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbae107)
* SUMMARY: We demonstrate that, in some cases, brain abnormalities associated with schizophrenia show signs of normalization over time. Additionally, we underscore the critical importance of modeling site-specific variability to ensure accurate inference. This is especially relevant in longitudinal neuroimaging studies, where changes in scanning protocols and equipment over time can introduce significant confounds if not properly accounted for.

**2024** Computational psychiatry and the evolving concept of a mental disorder. ***Synthese***. [link](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-024-04741-6)
* SUMMARY: We explore the pursuit of a coherent framework for research and treatment in psychiatry, driven by growing dissatisfaction with traditional concepts of mental disorders. This exploration incorporates various computational paradigms, including normative modeling, network theory, and learning-theoretic approaches. Each of these paradigms offers unique methodologies and visions for reconceptualizing mental disorders. In this discussion, we examine their similarities, differences, and potential conceptual conflicts.

**2024** Characterising personalized neuropathology in dementia and mild cognitive impairment with explainable artificial intelligence. ***Nature Partner Journals Digital Medicine***. [link](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.22.23291592)
*	SUMMARY: We trained a deep neural network to predict dementias. We use explainable machine learning to tease apart individual differences and make predictions (over time) on whether a specific individual develops dementia. We can do that up to 7 years early with good reliability.

**2024** Mapping Cerebellar Anatomical Heterogeneity in Mental and Neurological Illnesses. ***Nature Mental Health***. [link](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.18.567647)
*	SUMMARY: We trained normative models on more than 50k individuals, charting the development of the cerebellum over the lifespan. We tease apart individual differences in patients with mental and neurological illness.

**2023** Regional, circuit and network heterogeneity of brain abnormalities in psychiatric disorders. ***Nature Neuroscience***. [link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01404-6) 
*	SUMMARY: We developed normative models and applied them to analyze various mental disorders. Our study meticulously characterized the resulting deviations at the voxel, regional, and network levels of the human brain. Notably, our findings reveal a higher degree of overlap across individuals at the network level.

**2022** Deep neural networks learn general and clinically relevant representations of the ageing brain. ***NeuroImage***. [link](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.29.21265645)
* SUMMARY: We trained a deep neural network on N > 50k individuals to predict the aging brain. We transferred this model to make clinical predictions. We show that scale matters also in deep machine learning based imaging. Our model has been benchmarked by another group to be the-state-of-the-art brain age model. It demonstrates increased robustness to domain shifts, albeit with the previously observed brain-age accuracy vs. disease detection trade-off.
  
**2022** Charting brain growth and aging at high spatial precision. ***eLife***. [link](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72904)
* SUMMARY: We charted normative models of the human brain at high spatial precision for a sample larger than 50k individuals. This is a massive population scale neuroimaging based normative modeling approach that can be translated to new samples and is freely available online for other scientists to use.
  
**2022** The normative modeling framework for computational psychiatry. ***Nature Protocols***. [link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35650452/)
* SUMMARY: We describe the normative modeling framework for computational psychiatry, providing a comprehensive exploration of its principles and significance within the discipline, while also offering accessible tools for analyzing data within this framework.

**2021** Replicating extensive brain structural heterogeneity in individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. ***Human Brain Mapping***. [link](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.20095091)
* SUMMARY: We replicated our earlier finding that patients in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and showed an individualized profile of normative brain deviations. This has been replicated by various groups and extends to different mental and neurological conditions.

**2019** Inter-individual differences in human brain structure and morphometry link to population variation in demographics and behavior. ***eLife***. [link](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.44443.001)
* SUMMARY: We could show that brain structure explaines a large proportion of functional interactions between different regions in the healthy human brain.

**2019** Individual differences v. the average patient: mapping the heterogeneity in ADHD using normative models. ***Psychological medicine***. [link](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291719000084)
* SUMMARY: We mapped the heterogeneity of ADHD at the level of the individual patient, showing that each patient had a distinct profile of deviations from the normative brain extending our finding in schizophrenia.

**2018** Mapping the heterogeneous phenotype of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder using normative models. ***JAMA psychiatry***. [link](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.2467)
* SUMMARY: We mapped the heterogeneity of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder showing an individualized profile of deviations from the normative structural brain. These results were very surprising and framed by the media as "Who is the average patient in psychiatry?". The results have been frequently replicated by us and other groups using various data-modalities, algorithms and samples.

**2015** From estimating activation locality to predicting disorder: a review of pattern recognition for neuroimaging-based psychiatric diagnostics. **Neuroscience & Biobehavioural Reviews**. [link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2015.08.001) 
* SUMMARY: In this paper, we showed that with increasing sample size the accuracy of pattern classification approaches for the prediction of mental disorders decreased. This is counterintuitive and in conflict with evidence in other fields that use pattern recognition approaches to predict e.g., image classes, likes cats and dogs. Generally, supervised machine learning algorithms tend to perform better with more training data. Therefore, this finding was very surprising. We could attribute it in parts to the high heterogeneity of mental disorders and a publication bias for better performing but not representative models. This work contributed to a debate on cross-validation failures and provides important evidence for the development of methods to map heterogeneity of mental disorders.
