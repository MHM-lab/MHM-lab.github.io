<img align="left" src="https://mhm-lab.github.io/images/athu.png" width="150 px" style="padding: 10px"> <br>
As a PhD candidate, I explore how individual brain structure and function diverge over time, aiming to model these trajectories to identify dysfunction and underlying mechanisms. I hold a degree in Cognitive Neuroscience from the Donders Institute. My research now focuses on stochastic, biologically informed models to capture the uncertainty inherent in psychiatric conditions. Outside the lab, I enjoy long walks, racquet sports, and contemplative art. I believe the best science is like the best art. It is porous, subversive and elegant. I try to meet both with alacrity.
