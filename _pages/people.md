## Sicheng Dai, PostDoc
<img align="left" src="https://mhm-lab.github.io/images/dai.png" width="150 px" style="padding: 10px"> <br>
I am interested in modeling and the analysis of brain networks in health and disease through the fusion of two fields: Network Science (e.g. network dynamics, multilayer networks), and Machine Learning (e.g. graph neural networks). Prior to this postdoc, I received my PhD in computer science from ENS Lyon, where I studied the dynamic patterns of human interaction within large-scale temporal (social) networks. Outside of research, I'm a passionate nature enthusiast and animal lover. [Sicheng's email](mailto:)

<img align="left" src="https://mhm-lab.github.io/images/samira.png" width="150 px" style="padding: 10px"> <br>
My primary interest is applying machine learning techniques to healthcare. I recently completed my BSc at the University of Tehran, where I focused on anomaly detection in medical images. Currently, I am pursuing an MSc at Columbia University while interning at the laboratory for mental health mapping. Here, I explore the use of large language models and its putative impact on mental health. Outside of research, I enjoy traveling, socializing, and reading novels. [Samira's email](mailto:)

## Atharva(Athu)) Kand, PhD Candidate 
<img align="left" src="https://mhm-lab.github.io/images/athu.jpg" width="150 px" style="padding: 10px"> <br>
I am an incoming PhD candidate interested in how brain structure and function diverge across individuals over time, and how we might model these trajectories not only to stratify dysfunction but to uncover mechanisms. My aim is to build computational models that remain sensitive to the lived experience of disordered brains and that can offer both clinical insight and mechanistic clarity. Before joining the MHM lab, I studied cognitive neuroscience at the Donders Institute with a focus on neural computation. I have worked across disciplines, from rodent memory research to embodied deep learning. I am currently exploring how stochastic, biologically-informed models might help capture the uncertainty central to psychiatric conditions. Outside of research, I enjoy long walks, slow Sundays, racquet sports and art that refuses easy interpretation. I believe the best science is like the best art. It is porous, subversive and elegant. I try to meet both with alacrity.

##  Milin Kim, PhD Candidate
<img align="left" src="https://mhm-lab.github.io/images/milin.png" width="150 px" style="padding: 10px"> <br>
I am interested in the development of the cerebellum over the lifespan and its role in neurological and mental disorders. In my PhD, I am mapping the trajectory of the cerebellum using machine learning methods and brain imaging of large populations. Before starting my PhD at Oslo University Hospital, I studied psychology at Seoul National University and continued with cognitive neuroscience at University of Oslo. Outside the lab I spend my time exploring Norwegian forests and fjords, baking macarons, and reading. [Milin's email](mailto:)

## Alia Mahama-Rodriguez, PhD Candidate
<img align="left" src="https://mhm-lab.github.io/images/alia.png" width="150 px" style="padding: 10px"> <br>
My research focuses on modeling heterogeneity in psychiatric disorders through the integration of neuroimaging,
transcriptomic, and behavioral data. I use machine learning to map individual-level
deviations in conditions such as major depressive disorder and schizophrenia, with a growing interest in
perturbational neurobiology—understanding how targeted disruptions reveal underlying system dynamics. Prior to
joining the lab, I worked in computational psychiatry and bioinformatics, developing scalable
pipelines for high-throughput neural and genomic data, with a focus on the structural and diagnostic inequities that
shape mental health outcomes. Outside the lab, I practice yoga, hike with my Borzoi Donatella, and explore
experimental sound through violin and theremin.

With a Ph.D. in statistical neuroimaging from Radboud University Medical Center, my expertise centers on addressing psychiatric disorder heterogeneity through normative modeling. Currently, as a research fellow at UCL's Department of Computer Science, I focus on advancing generative models for neuroimaging data analysis. Concurrently, in a part-time PostDoc role in Tübingen, I delve into deep normative modeling techniques to discern individual differences within neuroimaging datasets. This dual engagement allows me to contribute significantly to both methodological advancements and the broader understanding of neurological diversity in psychiatric research.
