## Sacha ten Broeke, MSc student
<img align="left" src="https://mhm-lab.github.io/images/sacha.png" width="150 px" style="padding: 10px"> <br>
Currently pursuing a Master's degree in Cognitive Neuroscience. In the lab, I am working on a comprehensive review article on the SSRI discontinuation syndrome. This endeavor not only encompasses summarizing the current state of knowledge but also delves into how prediction tools can be harnessed to assess the risk associated with this syndrome. My academic pursuits extend beyond this project, with a keen focus on neural prosthetics and clinical neuropsychology. These areas of interest reflect my dedication to advancing understanding and practical applications within the intersection of neuroscience and clinical practice. [Sacha's email](mailto:)

## Sicheng Dai, PostDoc
<img align="left" src="https://mhm-lab.github.io/images/dai.png" width="150 px" style="padding: 10px"> <br>
I am interested in modeling and the analysis of brain networks in health and disease through the fusion of two fields: Network Science (e.g. network dynamics, multilayer networks), and Machine Learning (e.g. graph neural networks). Prior to this postdoc, I received my PhD in computer science from ENS Lyon, where I studied the dynamic patterns of human interaction within large-scale temporal (social) networks. Outside of research, I'm a passionate nature enthusiast and animal lover. [Sicheng's email](mailto:)
