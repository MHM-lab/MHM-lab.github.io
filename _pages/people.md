## Sicheng Dai, PostDoc, Tübingen
<img align="left" src="https://mhm-lab.github.io/images/dai.png" width="150 px" style="padding: 10px"> <br>
I'm a postdoc curious about connectomes and its potential to provide profound insights into mental health challenges. I am interested in modeling and the analysis of brain networks through the fusion of two fields: Network Science (network dynamics, multilayer networks etc.), and Machine Learning (neuroimaging processing, graph neural networks). Prior to this postdoc, I received my PhD in computer science from ENS Lyon, where I studied the dynamic patterns of human interaction with large-scale temporal (social) networks. Outside research, I'm a passionate nature enthusiast and animal lover. [Sicheng's email](mailto:)

## Minh-Hieu Nguyen, MSc student, Tübingen
<img align="left" src="https://mhm-lab.github.io/images/mh_pic.png" width="150 px" style="padding: 10px"> <br>
I am interested in the development of computational models to understand the mechanisms behind learning and decision-making processes, and how those change in individuals with mental disorders. Previously, I studied chemistry at the National University of Singapore before starting my master in neural information processing at the University of Tübingen. Outside of the lab, I enjoy cooking, music and reading. [Minh-Hieu's email](mailto:)

##  Milin Kim, PhD candidate, Oslo
<img align="left" src="https://mhm-lab.github.io/images/milin_pic.png" width="150 px" style="padding: 10px"> <br>
I am interested in the development of the cerebellum over the lifespan and its role in neurological and mental disorders. In my PhD, I am mapping the trajectory of the cerebellum using machine learning methods and brain imaging of large populations. Before starting my PhD at Oslo University Hospital, I studied psychology at Seoul National University and continued with cognitive neuroscience at University of Oslo. Outside the lab I spend my time exploring Norwegian forests and fjords, baking macarons, and reading. [Milin's email](mailto:milink@student.sv.uio.no)

##  Esten Leonardsen, PhD candidate, Oslo
<img align="left" src="https://mhm-lab.github.io/images/esten_pic.png" width="150 px" style="padding: 10px"> <br>
My research interests are on the continuous development of deep learning techniques, especially applied to neuroimaging data. I want to employ these methods to learn more about variation occurring in our brains, both in healthy individuals and those affected by mental as well as neurological disorders. I am also interests in the philosophical intersection of deep learning and neuroscience, philosophy of mind, and about gaining a formal understanding of learning, intelligence, and other cognitive phenomena. Outside of the lab I have cofounded start-up companies and enjoy reading. [Esten's email](mailto:esten.leonardsen@psykologi.uio.no)

## Sarah Sabotta, MSc student, Tübingen
<img align="left" src="https://mhm-lab.github.io/images/sarah_pic.png" width="150 px" style="padding: 10px"> <br>
I am a master’s student in Neural and Behavioral Sciences and have an interdisciplinary background. My neuroscientific research interests are in human cognitive and psychiatric research. In my master’s thesis, I incorporate kinship information into a normative modeling framework. Outside of academia, I am passionate about education, art, the environment, and kind people.

## Elias Schreiner, Data Scientist & IT-Infrastructure, Tübingen
<img align="left" src="https://mhm-lab.github.io/images/elias.png" width="150 px" style="padding: 10px"> <br>
I am a bioinformatics enthusiast working in IT infrastructure and science. I leverage the potential of deep learning to unlock insights from complex biological data. I belief that using this technology can enhance our understanding of the biological world, particularly in the context of improving the lives of those affected by neurodegenerative conditions and it’s often comorbid mental disorders.

## Philipp Seidel, PostDoc, Tübingen
<img align="left" src="https://mhm-lab.github.io/images/philipp_pic1.jpg" width="150 px" style="padding: 10px"> <br>
I obtained my doctoral degree at the Regensburg University. Since July 2023, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Laboratory for Mental Health Mapping in Tübingen. I focus on using computational models to find differences in brain measures (structural/functional) between healthy- and patient populations to potentially better understand how, e.g., psychiatric diseases develop and potentially be detected at an early stage.

## Nitin Sharma, MSc student, Tübingen
<img align="left" src="https://mhm-lab.github.io/images/nit_pic.jpg" width="150 px" style="padding: 10px"> <br>
I am currently pursuing my master's in Neural Information Processing. My research interest lies in understanding the underlying mechanisms of mental disorders with the help of machine learning. During my internship and bachelor's thesis, I worked on EEG and MRI/fMRI datasets, exploring deep learning-based domain adaptation methods on multi-site datasets for mental disorders such as depression. I am working with Dr. Wolfers to chart individual differences employing Normative modeling and machine-learning techniques. Outside of the lab, I enjoy spending time with friends, go for hiking, and listening to music. [Nitin's email](mailto:)

## Thomas Wolfers, PI, Tübingen
<img align="left" src="https://mhm-lab.github.io/images/thomas_pic.png" width="150 px" style="padding: 10px"> <br>
In my research I develop machine learning methods to understand factors that contribute to (mental) health problems in individuals. I hold a PhD in neuroscience from the Radboud University and have been working as a Postdoc in Netherlands (Radboud University), researcher in Norway (University of Oslo), and visiting scholar in the United Kingdom (University of Oxford) before starting my research group in Tübingen (Germany). In the long run, I aim to implement technological developments into clinical practice working together with clinicians and researchers. Outside of the lab, I study yoga, meditation and enjoy reading but also like social activities and music.

## Hao-Chun (Chad) Yang, PostDoc, Tübingen
<img align="left" src="https://mhm-lab.github.io/images/yang_pic.png" width="150 px" style="padding: 10px"> <br>
I'm a PostDoc with a keen interest in the intersection of machine learning and health applications. My particular interests lie in developing robust and reliable ML techniques, including Large-scale Self-Supervised Learning, Adversarial Attacks/Privacy, and Continuous Learning methods. I specialize in developing ML models from Multi-Modality signals, such as Electrical Physiologies (ECG/EDA/EEG), Medical Images (MRI), and Speech Processing. Before joining the MHM-Lab, I received my PhD in Electrical Engineering from National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan, with a research focus on Affective Computing. In my free time, I enjoy exploring outdoor activities, studying exotic meals, and traveling. [Chad's email](mailto:chadyang.hc@gmail.com)

## Mariam Zabihi, PostDoc, London & Tübingen
<img align="left" src="https://mhm-lab.github.io/images/mariam.png" width="150 px" style="padding: 10px"> <br>
I received my Ph.D. in statistical neuroimaging from the Predictive Clinical Neuroscience Lab at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, in 2022. My doctoral research focused on addressing the heterogeneity in psychiatric disorders using normative modeling. Currently, I am a research fellow at the Department of Computer Science at the University College London (UCL), UK, where I am engaged in the method development of generative models as well as small-object detection models for neuroimaging data. In Tubingen, I work on multi-modal deep normative modeling. [Mariam's email](mailto:)
