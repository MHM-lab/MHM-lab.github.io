I am interested in modeling and the analysis of brain networks in health and disease through the fusion of two fields: Network Science (e.g. network dynamics, multilayer networks), and Machine Learning (e.g. graph neural networks). Prior to this postdoc, I received my PhD in computer science from ENS Lyon, where I studied the dynamic patterns of human interaction within large-scale temporal (social) networks. Outside of research, I'm a passionate nature enthusiast and animal lover. [Sicheng's email](mailto:)
