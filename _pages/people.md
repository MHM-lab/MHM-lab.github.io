I am currently a third-year bachelor (honors) student of psychology at the Radboud University in the Netherlands.
For my honors program I write a critical review about the role a withdrawl symptoms from SSRIs in depression.
I am interested in psychology and medical research questions pertaining the biology underlying mental illness in particular depression. [Sacha's email](mailto:sacha.tenbroeke@ru.nl)

I am interested in the development of the cerebellum over the lifespan and its role in neurological and mental disorders. In my PhD, I am mapping the trajectory of the cerebellum using machine learning methods and brain imaging of large populations. Before starting my PhD at Oslo University Hospital, I studied psychology at Seoul National University and continued with cognitive neuroscience at University of Oslo. Outside the lab I spend my time exploring Norwegian forests and fjords, baking macarons, and readingr. [Milin's email](mailto:milink@student.sv.uio.no)
