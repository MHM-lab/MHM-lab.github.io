## Attentive, kind, and honest in communication

Communication is one of the most difficult, yet one of the most important interpersonal skills. Skillful communication can be cultivated. We try to foster a laboratory based on attentive, kind, and honest communication. We will dedicate some time to think about what it means for us individually and as a group and support each other in becoming better communicators with ourselves and each other.

## Celebrate and support each other 

While there is awareness that the science of today rewards the individual rather than the group, we at least aim to rejoice in the success of others. While we have limited powers to change current scientific reward systems, it is important to acknowledge that we are part of a collective striving towards a larger goal. Without the people in our environment nothing is possible, and nothing would be archived.

## Embrace diversity

We value diversity and try to minimise biases. This is not always easy therefore we keep each other in check when unconscious biases, false beliefs, or another sneaky mind-blindness maybe at play. Our goal is to achieve equality of opportunity.

## Acknowledge and learn from failure(s)

We are expected to fail, and we aim to learn from it. We help each other failing towards our goals and forgive if that happens. Even if we cannot live up to our own values, we will strive and support each other to be better next time. Life is a journey, and shapes us, we acknowledge that every new path requires trial and error. This is the foundation of learning.
