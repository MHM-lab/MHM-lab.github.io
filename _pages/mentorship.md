When the student is ready the teacher will appear - Tao Te Ching. Finding the right mentor for a given task is an important step towards its completion. Whatever role, status, and hierarchy one has in the completion of a given task, these are considered fluent and non-substantial. The authority of competence is the only guiding principle for influence on adressing a task. In other words, the most competent person has also the most to contribute to a given task and thus the largest say. However, with this acknowledgment the invitation emerges to mentor fellow lab members towards a better and more fundamental understanding of a given problem and to share insights.

## Individual mentorship for students from India

[Rajanikanth](https://www.evolutionguy.net) and Thomas met at a chai shop at the University of Mysore in India in 2015. At that time, Raj was a MSc student interested in evolution and Thomas PhD student with a fascination for the same topic. We bonded over several books, developed a friendship over the years and mentored each other. Thomas, Rai on how to navigate science, statistics, and writing. Raj, Thomas on how science works in India, molecular evolution, and fly genetics. Raj is now completing his PhD and is applying for Postdocs. Thomas has lived for many years in India and loves country and its people. Raj is born in India and knows all the beautiful and difficult parts of the journey through a university in India. Since some time, we played with the idea to extend our mutual mentorship experience to other people by taking on mentees from India. We would like to mentor students who are among the first generation in their family to go to university. We will share our experience and will help you to achieve your goals buy providing feedback and advice on the navigation through University. If you are interested write a short letter of motivation to Raj [email](mailto:rajanikanth.cnayak@gmail.com) and/or Thomas [email](mailto:dr.thomas.wolfers@gmail.com).
