Did not try it myself but a friend suggested to check out the local newspaper which are the [Schwäbisches Tagblatt](https://www.tagblatt.de) or the [Reutlinger General-Anzeiger](https://www.gea.de). You can also consider advertising your search there, sometimes you get lucky.

I found my apartment via contacts at my work and get the feeling that it often works in this way. Thus, reach out to your employer, colleagues, and people in general for help. When you search don't get too frustrated about the process. It is difficult to find something and a bit of luck is required.

### 2) How to calculate your income and what are the living costs?<br>

Living costs in Germany are currently increasing but your purchasing power is high in comparison. You can find shared housing from ~250-300 Euros per month to flats for yourself of ~70-150 sqm between ~700-1600 Euros per month. The food is good in quality and affordable, as are drinks. I pay about 100-160 Euros for food and drinks per week and I don’t check prices at all. I have a vegetarian diet and often buy biological products.

Tübingen is a very pretty city. It is a typical fairy-tale town and very stunning especially in summer. You can check out a [touristic video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTZKXl_tUsI&t=10s) or [video from a student]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28dIzix5sG4) or a[walking tour]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDBO1AwQDO0&t=344s) if you like to see more. All these videos give an impression.  In Tübingen you can have great dinners, walks, relax and chill in town.

<br>
The environment around Tübingen is stunning, you are in nature walking for a few meters. The Alps are two hours by car, and you can do all kinds of outdoors stuff in and around Tübingen. Within two hours you have all kinds of castles to visit. There are also great Saunas and baths in the area for instance in Bad Urach, which you can reach by train or car directly from the city.
<br>
<br>
As Tübingen is a student city there is some nightlife. Mostly in town but of course not comparable with cities such as Berlin. For good clubs and nightlife, you must go to Stuttgart (45 min by train) or any of the other larger cities in the area. When Stuttgart21 is finished, Tübingen will be well connected to Stuttgart, Munich, and Paris by fast trains. However, only God knows how long this will take.
