Useful links: <br>

<br>
<br>
Tübingen is a typical German fairy-tale town and very beautiful especially in summer. You can check out a [touristic video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTZKXl_tUsI&t=10s) or a [video from a student]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28dIzix5sG4) or a [walking tour]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDBO1AwQDO0&t=344s) if you like to see more.
<br>
<br>
The natural environment around Tübingen is stunning. You are in nature after you walked for a few minutes, and all kinds of outdoor activities are possible. The alps are about two hours by car, and you find a lot of different castles relatively close by some of them are [known](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schloss_Neuschwanstein) and others more [unknown](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burg_Hohenzollern). There are also great baths in the area e.g., in Bad Urach, where you can also find waterfalls. In summary, there is plenty to do in and around town.
<br>
<br>
As Tübingen is a student city there is a bit of nightlife, but clubbing is probably better in Stuttgart (~45 min by train). You have organized parties, which are sometimes advertised via the [schoener-leben](https://lists.schokokeks.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/schoener-leben) email list. If you like a beer in the evening, Tübingen has picturesque sceneries, lovely bars, and historic pubs. There are also many good restaurants.

### 4) How to find an apartment in Tübingen? <br>
Useful links:<br>
[Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Tuebingen.Immo) > was not helpful for me<br>
[WG gesucht](https://www.wg-gesucht.de) > helpful but difficult to get responses<br>
[Ebay Kleinanzeigen](https://www.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de) > helpful but difficult to get responses<br>
[Schöner wohnen](https://lists.schokokeks.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/schoener-wohnen) > seems helpful but did not use it
<br>
<br>
Did not try it myself but a friend suggested to check out the local newspaper which are the [Schwäbisches Tagblatt](https://www.tagblatt.de) or the [Reutlinger General-Anzeiger](https://www.gea.de). You can also consider advertising your search there, sometimes you get lucky. 
<br>
<br>
I found my apartment via contacts at my work and get the feeling that it often works in this way. Thus, reach out to your employer, colleagues, and people in general for help. When you search don't get too frustrated about the process. It is difficult to find something, and a bit of luck is required.

### 5) How German is it and how much German do you need?<br>

<br>
<br>
Tübingen is a beautiful German town which is visible everywhere. Sometimes this means that you fill in more forms than you would want to and that some shops prefer your payment in paper. However, these inconveniences are paid back through a very relaxing attitude and a very good vibe in town. People smile a lot and seem generally to be very content.
<br>
<br>
When you work in science, German is not a requirement. However, some of the social life happens in German. Thus, it is good to learn it a bit, but I know many people who cannot speak German or do not speak it perfectly and like it a lot in Tübingen.
<br>
<br>
Depending on your residence status, you may be entitled to attend a so-called integration course which includes German language.

### 6) How to calculate your income and what are the living costs? <br>
Useful links:<br>
[TV-L calculator](https://www.oeffentlichen-dienst.de/rechner/339-2022/3846-tv-l-2022.html) > very useful calculator for your income when you work at the University
<br>
<br>
Living costs in Germany are currently increasing but your purchasing power is high in comparison. You can find shared housing from ~250-300 Euros per month to flats for yourself of ~70-150 sqm between ~700-1600 Euros per month. The food is good in quality and affordable, as are drinks. I pay about 100-160 Euros for food and drinks per week and I don’t check prices at all. I have a vegetarian diet and often buy biological products.

### 7) What social support systems do exist?<br>
Useful links:<br>
[Welcome Centre @ University] (https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/international/welcome-center/registration/) > here you find all kinds of useful information getting started in Tübingen.
<br>
<br>
You have all kinds of social support systems e.g., unemployment insurance as well as health care insurance. You can ask the [Welcome Centre @ University] (https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/international/welcome-center/registration/) for advice.

### 8) What insurances do you need? <br>
Useful links:<br>
<br>
<br>
There are many public insurance schemes that provide support at old age and in cases of poor health, unemployment, and accidents. Every person in employment pays contributions to such insurance and will get some of the money back when he or she needs it. There are insurances that are required and others that are not. Google those and check what is useful for you.
1)	Required insurances: 1) Health Insurance (Krankenversicherung) 2) Pension Insurance Scheme (Rentenversicherung), 3) Long-Term Care Insurance (Pflegeversicherung), 4) Unemployment Insurance (Arbeitslosenversicherung): 5) Accident Insurance (Unfallversicherung 
2)	Not required insurances: 1) Third-Party Private Liability Insurance (Private Haftpflichtversicherung) > ***definitely get one*** 2) Household Contents Insurance (Hausratversicherung) 3) Disability Insurance (Berufsunfähigkeitsversicherung) 4) Legal Expenses Insurance  5) Life Assurance (Lebensversicherung)

### 9) What about child support?<br>
Useful links:<br>
[Family Center @ University](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/international/welcome-center/guide-for-international-researchers/family-and-children/) > center for families with one of the family members working at the University <br>
<br>
<br>
Day-care in Germany has a great quality. If you come with your family, your children are entitled to a place in day-care. Usually it is for free, sometimes it is not a public day-care but private, then you must pay about ~150-250 Euros per months. Food is provided to your kids and the quality of day-care is very good. Generally, family support in Germany is fabulous. You get extra financial support and have the right to take up to 14 months of paid parental leave at 60% of your last salary after you/or your partner gave birth. As a family you can decide how you share this time. In addition, there is maternity leave. There are international schools and you can ask for advice from the [Family Centre @ University](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/international/welcome-center/guide-for-international-researchers/family-and-children/).

### 10) How many vacation days do you have?<br>
