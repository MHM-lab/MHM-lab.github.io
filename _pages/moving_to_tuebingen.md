### 1) How to find an apartment in Tübingen?<br>

<br>
<br>
Did not try it myself but a friend suggested to check out the local newspaper which are the [Schwäbisches Tagblatt](https://www.tagblatt.de) or the [Reutlinger General-Anzeiger](https://www.gea.de). You can also consider advertising your search there, sometimes you get lucky. 
<br>
<br>
I found my apartment via contacts at my work and get the feeling that it often works in this way. Thus, reach out to your employer, colleagues, and people in general for help. When you search don't get too frustrated about the process. It is difficult to find something and a bit of luck is required.

### 2) How to calculate your income and what are the living costs?<br>

<br>
<br>
Living costs in Germany are currently increasing but your purchasing power is high in comparison. You can find shared housing from ~250-300 Euros per month to flats for yourself of ~70-150 sqm between ~700-1600 Euros per month. The food is good in quality and affordable, as are drinks. I pay about 100-160 Euros for food and drinks per week and I don’t check prices at all. I have a vegetarian diet and often buy biological products.

### 3) What can you do in and around Tübingen?<br>
Useful links:<br>

<br>
<br>
Tübingen is a typical German fairy-tale town and very beautiful especially in summer. You can check out a [touristic video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTZKXl_tUsI&t=10s) or a [video from a student]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28dIzix5sG4) or a [walking tour]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDBO1AwQDO0&t=344s) if you like to see more.
<br>
<br>
The environment around Tübingen is stunning. You are in nature after you walked for a few minutes, and all kinds of outdoor activities are possible. The alps are two hours by car, and you find many castles some of them [known](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schloss_Neuschwanstein) and others more [unknown](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burg_Hohenzollern). There are also great saunas and baths in the area e.g., in Bad Urach, where you can also find waterfalls. In summary, there is plenty to do in and around town.
<br>
<br>
As Tübingen is a student city there is a bit of nightlife, but clubbing is probably better in Stuttgart (~60 min by train). You have organised parties, which are sometimes advertised via the [schoener-leben](https://lists.schokokeks.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/schoener-leben) email list. If you like a beer in the evening, Tübingen has picturesque sceneries, lovely bars, and historic pubs. There are also many good restaurants.

### 4) How German is it and how much German do you need?<br>

<br>
<br>
Being German is not considered to be such a bad thing anymore. Apart from the fact that we do not have humour this change in opinion is earned! Tübingen is a beautiful German town which is visible everywhere. Sometimes this means that you fill in more forms than you would want to and that some shops prefer your payment in paper. However, these inconveniences are paid back through a very relaxing attitude and a very good vibe in town. People smile a lot and seem generally to be very content.
<br>
<br>
When you work in science, German is not a requirement. However, some of the social life happens in German. Thus, it is good to learn it a bit, but I know many people who cannot speak German or do not speak it perfectly and like it a lot in Tübingen.

### 6) What insurances do you need?<br>
Useful links:<br>
<br>
<br>
There are many public insurance schemes that provide support at old age and in cases of poor health, unemployment and accidents. Every person in employment pays contributions to such insurance and will get some of the money back when he or she needs it.
<br>
<br>
Insurances that are required and come with your employment (check when you start working)
1) Health Insurance (Krankenversicherung): Every person in Germany must have health insurance. There are many different health insurance companies. You can choose your health insurance company yourself.If your spouse already has health insurance coverage, you and any joint children can be co-insured (family insurance). You will be given a health insurance card as proof of your health insurance membership. Please always take the card with you when you visit a doctor because you will need to show it there.When you arrive in Germany, you can keep your foreign health insurance until you start working in Germany. If you are emplo- yed abroad but work in Germany for some time, you may also take out international health insurance in your home country.
<br>
2) Pension Insurance Scheme (Rentenversicherung): The old-age pension insurance scheme will pay you benefits when you are old, usually as from your 67th birthday.
<br>
3) Long-Term Care Insurance (Pflegeversicherung): The long-term care insurance will help you if you can no longer look after yourself. It will, for example, pay a person who assists you in the daily routine.
<br>
4) Unemployment Insurance (Arbeitslosenversicherung): The unemployment insurance will pay you benefits if you lose your job.
<br>
5) Accident Insurance (Unfallversicherung)
The accident insurance will pay you benefits if you can no longer work as a result of an accident.
<br>
<br>
More or less useful (extra) insurances. Have a critical look, insurance companies often try to sell you stuff you don't really need.
<br>
1) Third-Party Private Liability Insurance (Private Haftpflichtversicherung): Third-party liability insurance will cover any damage caused by you to third-party property. If you have any children, it is recommended to coinsure them. > useful insurance.
<br>
2) Household Contents Insurance (Hausratversicherung): Household contents insurance policies cover damage in your own household. Make sure that the insured sum does not exceed the value of items in your household. > usefulness depends on what you store in your house
<br> Disability Insurance (Berufsunfähigkeitsversicherung): The disability insurance provides coverage if you can no longer carry out your current occupation or are unable to work at all for various reasons. > useful especially if you are young and have responsibility towards other people (family). As you get older this insurance is less useful.
<br>
Legal Expenses Insurance: The legal expenses insurance will help you in legal proceedings. That means that it will pay the costs for a lawyer. > can be useful especially if you have difficult neighbours but most of the time it is a waste of resources.
Life Assurance (Lebensversicherung). > can be useful especially if you have difficult neighbours but most of the time it is a waste of resources.
Life assurance provides financial security, for example for family members when the insured dies.

Daycare in Germany has a great quality. If you come with your family, your children are entitled to a place in daycare. Usually it is for free, sometimes it is not a public daycare but private, then you have to pay about ~150-250 Euros per months. Food is provided to your kids and the quality of daycare is very good. You can ask for advide from the [FamilyCenter@University](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/international/welcome-center/guide-for-international-researchers/family-and-children/).
<br>
<br>
Generally family support in Germany is fabulous. You get extra financial support and have the right to take up to 14 months of payed parental leave at 60% of your last salary after you/or your partner gave birth. As a family you can decide how you share this time. In addition there is maternity leave.
