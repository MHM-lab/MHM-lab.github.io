Here you find information about moving to Tübingen and Germany. You find some tips as well as useful links. Please write an [email](mailto:dr.thomas.wolfers@gmail.com) if information should be included! 

### 1) How to find an apartment in Tübingen?<br>

[WG-gesucht](https://www.wg-gesucht.de) > helpful but difficult to get responses<br>
[Ebay-Kleinanzeigen](https://www.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de) > helpful but difficult to get responses<br>

<br>
<br>
Did not try it myself but a friend suggested to check out the local newspaper which are the [Schwäbisches Tagblatt](https://www.tagblatt.de) or the [Reutlinger General-Anzeiger](https://www.gea.de). You can also consider advertising your search there, sometimes you get lucky. 
<br>
<br>
I found my apartment via contacts at my work and get the feeling that it often works in this way. Thus, reach out to your employer, colleagues, and people in general for help. When you search don't get too frustrated about the process. It is difficult to find something and a bit of luck is required.

### 2) How to calculate your income and what are the living costs?<br>

<br>
<br>
Living costs in Germany are currently increasing but your purchasing power is high in comparison. You can find shared housing from ~250-300 Euros per month to flats for yourself of ~70-150 sqm between ~700-1600 Euros per month. The food is good in quality and affordable, as are drinks. I pay about 100-160 Euros for food and drinks per week and I don’t check prices at all. I have a vegetarian diet and often buy biological products.

### 3) What can you do in and around Tübingen?<br>

<br>
<br>
Tübingen is a typical German fairy-tale town and very beautiful especially in summer. You can check out a [touristic video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTZKXl_tUsI&t=10s) or a [video from a student]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28dIzix5sG4) or a [walking tour]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDBO1AwQDO0&t=344s) if you like to see more.
<br>
<br>
The environment around Tübingen is stunning. You are in nature after you walked for a few minutes, and all kinds of outdoor activities are possible. The alps are two hours by car, and you find many castles some of them [known](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schloss_Neuschwanstein) and others more [unknown](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burg_Hohenzollern). There are also great saunas and baths in the area e.g., in Bad Urach, where you can also find waterfalls. In summary, there is plenty to do in and around town.
<br>
<br>
As Tübingen is a student city there is a bit of nightlife, but clubbing is probably better in Stuttgart (~60 min by train). You have organised parties, which are sometimes advertised via the [schoener-leben](https://lists.schokokeks.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/schoener-leben) email list. If you like a beer in the evening, Tübingen has picturesque sceneries, lovely bars, and historic pubs. There are also many good restaurants.

### 4) How German is it and how much German do you need?<br>

<br>
<br>
Being German is not considered to be such a bad thing anymore. Apart from the fact that we do not have humour this change in opinion is earned! Tübingen is a beautiful German town which is visible everywhere. Sometimes this means that you fill in more forms than you would want to and that some shops prefer your payment in paper. However, these inconveniences are paid back through a very relaxing attitude and a very good vibe in town. People smile a lot and seem generally to be very content.
<br>
<br>
When you work in science, German is not a requirement. However, some of the social life happens in German. Thus, it is good to learn it a bit, but I know many people who cannot speak German or do not speak it perfectly and like it a lot in Tübingen.

<br>
<br>
Daycare in Germany has a great quality. If you come with your family, your children are entitled to a place in daycare. Usually it is for free, sometimes it is not a public daycare but private, then you have to pay about ~150-250 Euros per months. Food is provided to your kids and the quality of daycare is very good. You can ask for advide from the [Family Center](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/international/welcome-center/guide-for-international-researchers/family-and-children/) at the University. 
<br>
<br>
Generally family support in Germany is fabulous. You get extra financial support and have the right to take up to 14 months of payed parental leave at 60% of your last salary after you/or your partner gave birth. As a family you can decide how you share this time.
