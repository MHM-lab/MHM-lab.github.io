Did not try it myself but a friend suggested to check out the local newspaper which are the [Schwäbisches Tagblatt](https://www.tagblatt.de) or the [Reutlinger General-Anzeiger](https://www.gea.de) . You can also consider advertising your search there, sometimes you get lucky.

Found my apartment via contacts at my work. Get the feeling that it often works in this way. Thus, reach out to your employer, colleagues, and people in general for help. When you search don't get too frustrated about the process it is difficult to find something and a bit of luck is required.

### 2) How to calculate your income and what are the living costs?<br>

Living costs in Germany are currently increasing but your purchasing power is quite high in comparison to most other countries. You can find shared housing from ~250-300 Euros per month to flats for yourself of ~70-150 sqm between ~700-1600 Euros per month. The food is good in quality and affordable, as are drinks. I pay about 120-160 Euros for food and drinks per week and I don’t check prices at all but also do not drink much apart from water. I have a vegetarian diet and often buy biological products.
