Did not try it myself but a friend suggested to check out the local newspaper which are the [Schwäbisches Tagblatt](https://www.tagblatt.de) or the [Reutlinger General-Anzeiger](https://www.gea.de). You can also consider advertising your search there, sometimes you get lucky.

I found my apartment via contacts at my work and get the feeling that it often works in this way. Thus, reach out to your employer, colleagues, and people in general for help. When you search don't get too frustrated about the process. It is difficult to find something and a bit of luck is required.

### 2) How to calculate your income and what are the living costs?<br>

Living costs in Germany are currently increasing but your purchasing power is high in comparison. You can find shared housing from ~250-300 Euros per month to flats for yourself of ~70-150 sqm between ~700-1600 Euros per month. The food is good in quality and affordable, as are drinks. I pay about 100-160 Euros for food and drinks per week and I don’t check prices at all. I have a vegetarian diet and often buy biological products.

### 3) What can you do in and around Tübingen?<br>

Tübingen is a typical German fairy-tale town and very beautiful especially in summer. You can check out a [touristic video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTZKXl_tUsI&t=10s) or a [video from a student]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28dIzix5sG4) or a [walking tour]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDBO1AwQDO0&t=344s) if you like to see more. In Tübingen you can have great dinners, walks, relaxing evenings, and chill in town. 
<br>
<br>
The environment around Tübingen is stunning. You are in nature after you walked for a few minutes, and you can do all kinds of outdoors in and around Tübingen. The alps are two hours by car, and you find castles all over, some of them [known](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schloss_Neuschwanstein) and others more [unknown](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burg_Hohenzollern). There are also great Saunas and baths in the area e.g., in Bad Urach, where can also find waterfalls. In summary, there is plenty to do in and around town.
<br>
<br>
As Tübingen is a student city there is a bit of nightlife, but clubbing is probably better in Stuttgart (~60 min by train). You have organised dance parties, which are sometimes advertised via the [schoener-leben](https://lists.schokokeks.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/schoener-leben) email list. If you like a beer in the evening, Tübingen has picturesque sceneries, lovely bars, and historic pubs.
