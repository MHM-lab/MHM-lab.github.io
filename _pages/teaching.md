title: "Teaching and Seminars"
---

We are committed contributing to the teaching portfolio at Friedrich Schiller University (FSU) by introducing a coherent, thoughtfully designed set of courses, modules and seminar formats. This teaching program is currently under development and will continue to mature over the coming years. The objective is to establish a high-quality, interdisciplinary instructional teaching stack, spanning Cognitive Neuroscience/Psychology, Brain Imaging, Machine Learning, and related domains, relevant not only for FSU students but also for national and international participants.

## Course 1: Parsing Individual Differences in Brain Disorders
This course introduces the foundations of individual-level inference in psychiatry, emphasizing the shift from traditional case–control analyses to normative modeling approaches that treat inter-individual variability as meaningful signal. Students are introduced to the development of normative models and their application to deviation mapping in large-scale clinical cohorts, alongside a critical discussion of proposed psychiatric “biotypes” and their limitations. By the end of the course, participants will understand how individual-level deviation scores are derived and why they constitute a central analytic currency in computational psychiatry. The course will be held across three weekends in January and early February. Students are required to read a book in advance to initiate discussions on individual differences, followed by an intensive theoretical block on modeling individual differences in brain disorders and a two-day hands-on practical focused on applied methods.

## Course 2: The 50 Most Influential Ideas in Neuroscience, Psychology & Machine Learning.
This course provides an overview of some of the most influential ideas across these fields. Each year, 14 ideas are selected from a curated pool of 50 seminal concepts and presented in weekly two-hour sessions held every Thursday during the summer term. The selection of topics is random, ensuring diversity and renewal across years. Each lecture introduces a central idea alongside the key papers that shaped its development and impact. By the end of the course, students will have gained a broad overview and a foundational understanding of these ideas, how they influenced one another, and how the different fields have intersected over time.
