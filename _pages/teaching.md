### Foundations of Heterogeneity and Individual-Level Modeling

This module introduces the conceptual backbone of modern individual-level inference in psychiatry, grounding students in the shift from case–control comparisons to models that explicitly quantify heterogeneity. We examine how normative modeling reframes variability as a structured, biologically informative signal, tracing its development from early work on population reference distributions (Marquand et al., 2016) to disorder-specific deviation mapping in large clinical cohorts (Wolfers et al., 2018). Participants will critically dissect the promises and pitfalls of “biotypes,” drawing on methodological analyses such as Dinga et al. (2019), and learn why robust heterogeneity modeling demands careful statistical specification, rigorous uncertainty quantification, and strong out-of-sample generalization. By the end of the section, students will understand how individual-level deviation scores emerge from these frameworks and why they form a central analytic currency for contemporary computational psychiatry.
