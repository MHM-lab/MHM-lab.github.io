We contribute to the teaching portfolio at Friedrich Schiller University (FSU) by developing an integrated, interdisciplinary teaching program spanning cognitive neuroscience, brain imaging, and machine learning, aimed at both FSU students and national and international participants.

## Course 1: Parsing Individual Differences in Brain Disorders.
This course introduces the foundations of individual-level inference in psychiatry, emphasizing the shift from traditional case–control analyses to normative modeling approaches that treat inter-individual variability as meaningful signal. Students are introduced to the development of normative models and their application to deviation mapping in large-scale clinical cohorts, alongside a critical discussion of proposed psychiatric “biotypes” and their limitations. By the end of the course, participants will understand how individual-level deviation scores are derived and why they constitute a central analytic currency in computational psychiatry. The course will be held across three weekends in January and early February. Students are required to read a book in advance to initiate discussions on individual differences, followed by an intensive theoretical block on modeling individual differences in brain disorders and a two-day hands-on practical focused on applied methods.

## Course 2: The 50 Most Influential Ideas in Neuroscience, Psychology & Machine Learning.
This course provides an overview of some of the most influential ideas across these fields. Each year, 14 ideas are selected from a curated pool of 50 seminal concepts and presented in weekly two-hour sessions held on most Thursdays during the summer term between 12:15 - 13:45. The selection of topics is random, ensuring diversity and renewal across years. Each lecture introduces a central idea alongside the key papers that shaped its development and impact. By the end of the course, students will have gained a broad overview and a foundational understanding of these ideas, how they influenced one another, and how the different fields have intersected over time.

## Semiar: Neuroscience and Machine Learning.
This seminar is designed for highly motivated students, with a maximum of five participants at a time, who are considering joining our lab for a Master’s thesis or a related research project. Students may apply to participate and will be selected based on motivation and fit. The seminar takes place Fridays from 14:00 - 15:30 and features presentations by postdoctoral researchers, PhD students, and collaborators. Selected students are expected to actively participate and, at an appropriate point, present either a relevant paper or their own research proposal.
