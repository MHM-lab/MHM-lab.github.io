		<font size="3">Clare is a postdoctoral fellow in the FINN Lab. She completed her Ph.D. and M.A. in communication at Michigan State University after receiving a B.A. in psychology and mass communication from Miami University. Clare leverages her expertise in media psychology and human communication to bring a message-centric approach to studying brain function and behavior as it occurs in response to the media we see in our everyday life. She loves to bring her background in media production and design into communicating research, and after 22 years of drawing notes in class she considers herself a professional doodler.</font><br>
