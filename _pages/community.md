In this section you find ways in which our lab contributes to a thriving science community.

## In Tübingen
We are a part of the [Department of Psychiatry at the University of Tübingen](https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/en-de/das-klinikum/einrichtungen/kliniken/psychiatrie-und-psychotherapie), which is one of the locations of the German Centre for Mental Health. Our group is a member of the [Cluster of Excellence: Machine Learning in Science](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/home/) and an associated faculty of the [IMPRS for intelligent systems](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/faculty) and faculty at the [IMPRS for mechanisms of mental function and dysfunction](https://imprs-mmfd.tuebingen.mpg.de/3866/faculty).

## Talks, courses, and workshops
Talks, courses, and workshops are an important aspect for a thriving scientific environment. For instance, we recently contributed to the organization of [Workshop on Machine Learning in Clinical Neuroimaging](https://mlcnworkshop.github.io) at MICCAI, taught at the [Computational Psychiatry Course at the ETH](https://www.translationalneuromodeling.org/cpcourse/), [Machine Learning for Neuroimaging at the University of Stanford](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psyc221/), LMU's computational psychiatry course and were invited speaker at Biological Psychiatry in the USA and at various machine learning conferences. We are also regularily invited for talks at national and international universities and collaborate with scientists at different Universities. We are happy to answer your questions or requests by [email](mailto:dr.thomas.wolfers@gmail.com).

## Education 
The goal of our lab is to provide an environment where education is joy. While science is often an endeavour one must work on in solitude, we will provide opportunities for collaborative education whenever possible. We aim to educate competent and confident students who can complete difficult tasks for society. In our lab you will be encouraged to learn the skills and personal qualities necessary to achieve whatever goal you put your mind to. We welcome people from any background to sign up for this journey.

## Mentorship
Finding the right mentor for a given task is an important step towards its execution and eventual completion. Competences change with time and topic. Thus, the mentor-student relationship is a dynamic process and not fixed. The ego, ideally, stays outside.
