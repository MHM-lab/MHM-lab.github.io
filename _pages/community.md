In this section you find the ways in which our lab contributes to a thriving science community through talks, education, and mentorship.

## Talks and workshops
Talks and workshops are an important aspect for a thriving scientific environment. We contribute to this environment locally, nationally, and internationally. You can get in touch with questions or requests by [email](mailto:dr.thomas.wolfers@gmail.com).

## Education 

The goal of our lab is to provide an environment where education is joy. While science is often an endeavour one must work on in solitude, we will provide opportunities for collaborative education whenever possible. We aim to educate competent and confident students who can complete difficult tasks for society. In our lab you will be encouraged to learn the skills and personal qualities necessary to achieve whatever goal you put your mind to. We welcome people from any background to sign up for this journey. Interdisciplinarity is our second nature, the only requirements you must fulfil are motivation and hard work, everything else can and will be learned. We are constructively critical towards each other and in this way, promote improvement in ourselves and others. In the end of your educational journey in our lab, we hope to have contributed to your independence and distinction in thought and action.

## Mentorship
When the student is ready the teacher will appear (Tao Te Ching). Finding the right mentor for a given task is an important step towards its execution and eventual completion. The most competent person on a given task has also the most to contribute and thus the largest say with respect to strategy and execution. From that the obligation follows that we educate each other towards a better and more fundamental understanding of a given problem and to share insights. The mentor-student relationship is a dynamic process. The ego, ideally, stays outside.

***Individual mentorship for students from India***

[Rajanikanth](https://www.evolutionguy.net) and Thomas met at a chai shop at the University of Mysore in India in 2016. At that time, Raj was a early MSc student interested in evolution and Thomas PhD student with a fascination for the same topic. We bonded over several books, developed a friendship over the years and mentored each other. Thomas, Rai on how to navigate science, statistics, and writing. Raj, Thomas on how science works in India, molecular evolution, and fly genetics. Raj is now completing his PhD and is applying for Postdocs. Thomas has lived for many years in India and loves country and its people. Raj is born in India and knows all the beautiful and difficult parts of the journey through a university in India. Since some time, we played with the idea to extend our mutual mentorship experience to other people by taking on mentees from India. We would like to mentor students who are among the first generation in their family to go to university. We will share our experience and will help you to achieve your goals by providing feedback and advice on the navigation through university. If you are interested write a short letter of motivation to [Raj](mailto:rajanikanth.cnayak@gmail.com) and/or [Thomas](mailto:dr.thomas.wolfers@gmail.com).
