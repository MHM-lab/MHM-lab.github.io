In this section you find ways in which our lab contributes to a thriving science community.

## In Jena, Germany
Funded by the [Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung](https://www.carl-zeiss-stiftung.de/en/), the [*Professorship for Artificial Intelligence in Neural Systems Imaging*](https://www.carl-zeiss-stiftung.de/en/project-overview/detail/czs-endowed-professorship-for-artificial-intelligence-in-neural-systems-imaging) at the [Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena](https://www.uni-jena.de/en/) connects research across the university and the [University Hospital Jena](https://www.uniklinikum-jena.de/en/), creating a joint environment for AI-driven neuroscience and clinical translation. Our group is part of the [German Center for Mental Health (DZPG)](https://www.dzpg.org) at the Halle–Jena–Magdeburg site, contributing to a national network for translational mental health research, with Thomas Wolfers serving as Principal Investigator. We actively build interdisciplinary bridges across Jena’s communities in machine learning, neuroscience, clinical research, cognitive science, and psychology. In addition, we are affiliated with the [ELLIS Unit Jena](https://www.ellis-jena.ai/thomas-wolfers/) and collaborate with researchers in Jena and across Europe.

## Beers, Brains & Backpropagation - The Jena ML Meetup
Every last Thursday of the month, we meet after work around 6:00 pm (or slightly later) at one of the bars in Jena. The idea is simple: ***a relaxed, informal get-together for anyone interested*** in neuroscience, machine learning, mental and brain health, psychology, or the environment. No talks, no slides, no agenda - just good conversations, about science or anything else.
The meetup is primarily for PostDocs, PhDs, and students, but the occasional PI is, of course, very welcome. If you don't drink no problem, they certainly have non-alcoholic beverages as well. Feel free to join, bring friends, and come as you are. Looking forward to seeing you.

## In Tübingen, Germany
We are a part of the [Department of Psychiatry at the University of Tübingen](https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/en-de/das-klinikum/einrichtungen/kliniken/psychiatrie-und-psychotherapie), which is one of the locations of the German Centre for Mental Health. Our group is an associated with the [IMPRS for intelligent systems](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/faculty) and the [IMPRS for mechanisms of mental function and dysfunction](https://imprs-mmfd.tuebingen.mpg.de/3866/faculty).

## Talks, courses, workshops and conferences
Talks, courses, workshops and conferences are an important aspect for a thriving scientific community. Therefore, we regularily contribute to the organization of [Workshop on Machine Learning in Clinical Neuroimaging](https://mlcnworkshop.github.io) at MICCAI, taught at the [Computational Psychiatry Course at the ETH](https://www.translationalneuromodeling.org/cpcourse/), [Machine Learning for Neuroimaging at the University of Stanford](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psyc221/), LMU's computational psychiatry course and were invited speaker at Biological Psychiatry in the USA and at various machine learning conferences. We were in the local organisation commmitee for the [Computational Psychiatry Conference](https://www.cpconf.org) in 2025, are part of the Scientific Programme Commitee for [ECNP 2026 in Munich](https://www.ecnp.eu), are currently helping to establish a research network on machine learning for mental health at the same conference, and also serve on the abstract committee for the same conference. Reach out for questions or requests by [email](mailto:dr.thomas.wolfers@gmail.com).

## Education 
The goal of our lab is to provide an environment where education is joy. While science is often an endeavour one must work on in solitude, we will provide opportunities for collaborative education whenever possible. We aim to educate competent and confident students who can complete difficult tasks for society. In our lab you will be encouraged to learn the skills and personal qualities necessary to achieve whatever goal you put your mind to. We welcome people from any background to sign up for this journey.

## Mentorship
Finding the right mentor for a given task is an important step towards its execution and eventual completion. Competences change with time and topic. Thus, the mentor-student relationship is a dynamic process and not fixed. The ego, ideally, stays outside.
