## Submission Requirements

The workshop seeks high-quality, original, and unpublished work that addresses one or more challenges described above. Papers should be submitted electronically in Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) style (see this [link]() for detailed author guidelines) using the CMT system here. The page limit is 8-pages (text, figures, and tables) plus up to 2-pages of references. We review the submissions in a double-blind process. Please make sure that your submission is anonymous. Accepted papers will be published in a joint proceeding with the MICCAI 2023 conference.

## Call for Papers 

In the ***machine learning track***, we seek novel contributions that address current methodological gaps in analyzing high-dimensional, longitudinal, and heterogeneous clinical neuroscientific data using stable, scalable, and interpretable machine learning models. In the ***clinical neuroimaging track*** papers with an applied focus are published. We invite the community to submit conference contributions on machine learning approaches with the goal to improve our understanding of complex brain disorders, moving the field closer to precision medicine.
