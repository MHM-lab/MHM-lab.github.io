## Submission Requirements

The workshop seeks high-quality, original, and unpublished work that addresses one or more challenges described above. Papers should be submitted electronically in Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) style (see this [link]() for detailed author guidelines) using the CMT system here. The page limit is 8-pages (text, figures, and tables) plus up to 2-pages of references. We review the submissions in a double-blind process. Please make sure that your submission is anonymous. Accepted papers will be published in a joint proceeding with the MICCAI 2022 conference.

## Call for Papers

* Big data
* Spatio-temporal brain data analysis
* Structural data analysis
* Graph theory and complex network analysis
* Longitudinal data analysis
* Model stability and interpretability
* Model scalability in large neuroimaging datasets
* Multi-source data integration and multi-view learning
* Multi-site data analysis, from preprocessing to modeling
* Domain adaptation, data harmonization, and transfer learning in neuroimaging
* Unsupervised methods for stratifying brain disorders

In the ***clinical neuroimaging track***, the applications of existing machine learning algorithms are evaluated to move towards precision medicine for complex brain disorders. The discovery of biological markers in medicine is an important challenge across different fields and various experimental procedures and designs are used to detect biological signatures that can be utilized for improvement in diagnostic, treatment, or for other beneficial ends. However, for most complex brain disorders, we do not have reliable biomarkers today. The application of advanced machine learning methods may help to reach this goal. Therefore, we invite the community to submit conference contributions on machine learning approaches with the goal to improve our understanding of complex brain disorders, moving the field closer to precision medicine. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
<br>
<br>
* Biomarker discovery 
* Refinement of nosology and diagnostics 
* Biological validation of clinical syndromes 
* Treatment outcome prediction 
* Course prediction 
* Analysis of wearable sensors
* Neurogenetics and brain imaging genetics
* Mechanistic modeling
* Brain aging
* Neuroimaging databases stimulating developments in machine learning
* …

## MELBA Journal 
We will invite the top accepted papers to submit an extended version of their contribution to the MLCN special issue at the Journal of Machine Learning for Biomedical Imaging (MELBA). The invited papers will go through an independent review process by the journal.
