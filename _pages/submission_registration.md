## Submission Requirements & Process:

To submit your work to the workshop, please ensure that it meets the following requirements:
<ul>
    <li>The submission should be high-quality, original, and unpublished work that addresses one or more of the challenges outlined by the workshop.</li>
    <li>The submission should be in electronic format and adhere to Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) style, which includes detailed author guidelines available at this <a href="https://conferences.miccai.org/2023/en/PAPER-SUBMISSION-AND-REBUTTAL-GUIDELINES.html#manuscriptpreparation">link</a>.</li>
    <li>The submission should be made through the CMT system, which can be accessed <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MLCN2023">here</a>. Please note that we use a double-blind review process, and therefore, submissions must be anonymous.</li>
    <li>The submission should not exceed a total of 8 pages, including figures, tables, and text. An additional 2 pages of references are allowed.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your paper is accepted, it will be published in a joint proceeding with the MICCAI 2023 conference. Once accepted, you will need to prepare a camera-ready submission according to the guidelines provided at this <a href="https://mlcnworkshop.github.io/camera_ready">link</a>.</p>

The workshop seeks high-quality, original, and unpublished work that addresses one or more challenges described below. Papers should be submitted electronically in Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) style (see this [link](https://conferences.miccai.org/2023/en/PAPER-SUBMISSION-AND-REBUTTAL-GUIDELINES.html#manuscriptpreparation) for detailed author guidelines) using the CMT system here. The page limit is 8-pages (text, figures, and tables) plus up to 2-pages of references. We review the submissions in a double-blind process. Please make sure that your submission is anonymous. Accepted papers will be published in a joint proceeding with the MICCAI 2023 conference.

## Call for Papers 

In the ***machine learning track***, we seek novel contributions that address current methodological gaps in analyzing high-dimensional, longitudinal, and heterogeneous clinical neuroscientific data using stable, scalable, and interpretable machine learning models. In the ***clinical neuroimaging track***, papers with an applied focus are published. We invite the community to submit conference contributions on machine learning approaches with the goal to improve our understanding of complex brain disorders, moving the field closer to precision medicine. 
<br>
<br>
Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
<br>
* Big data
* Spatio-temporal brain data analysis
* Structural data analysis
* Graph theory and complex network analysis
* Longitudinal data analysis
* Model stability and interpretability
* Model scalability in large neuroimaging datasets
* Multi-source data integration and multi-view learning
* Multi-site data analysis, from preprocessing to modeling
* Domain adaptation, data harmonization, and transfer learning in neuroimaging
* Unsupervised methods for stratifying brain disorders
* Deep learning in clinical neuroimaging
* Model uncertainty in clinical predictions
* Biomarker discovery 
* Refinement of nosology and diagnostics 
* Biological validation of clinical syndromes 
* Treatment outcome prediction 
* Course prediction 
* Analysis of wearable sensors
* Neurogenetics and brain imaging genetics
* Mechanistic modeling
* Brain aging
* Database for machine learning
* …


## Submission process

Papers should be submitted electronically in Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) style (see this [link](https://conferences.miccai.org/2023/en/PAPER-SUBMISSION-AND-REBUTTAL-GUIDELINES.html#manuscriptpreparation) for detailed author guidelines) using the [CMT system here](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MLCN2023) .
If your article is accepted, you will be asked to create a [camera ready submission following these guidelines](https://mlcnworkshop.github.io/camera_ready).

## MELBA Journal 
We will invite the top accepted papers to submit an extended version of their contribution to the MLCN special issue at the Journal of Machine Learning for Biomedical Imaging (MELBA). The invited papers will go through an independent review process by the journal.
