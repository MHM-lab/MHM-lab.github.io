title: "Camera Ready Submission"

We follow the same procedure as MICCAI 2022 for camera-ready submission available at this link. Camera-ready material must be submitted by Friday, Aug 8, 2022. As described below, all the files must be uploaded to the submission site as a single zipped file of 350 MB or less (CMT system limit). Please submit your file via the "submit camera-ready file" link in your CMT user dashboard. 

•	The authors must address the minor changes provided by the comments from reviewers; please include a file entitled ‘Changes after review' with a bulleted list of the modifications to the paper.
•	Identify ONE corresponding author, who must be available to carry out a proof check of the paper. Springer will contact the corresponding author approximately 3 weeks before the conference and the corresponding author will only be given a 72-hour timeslot to do so. See the FAQ page for answers related to multiple corresponding authors.
•	The copyright form available at this link must be signed by the corresponding author of the paper. A digital signature is not acceptable.
•	The camera-ready copy with all figures and the signed copyright form must be uploaded to the paper submission system within a single zip file; See the checklist below.
•	Each paper must be associated with a unique MLCN 2022 registration. Authors can present multiple papers with a single registration only if they are the first authors of all papers.
The proceedings will be published as Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) in both electronic and paper versions by Springer. Please read carefully the information for authors from Springer. You must use the LNCS templates (LaTeX2e or Word) available on the Springer website to prepare your paper. The templates are also available in Overleaf.

To accommodate changes requested by the reviewers while also still accommodating additional content that Springer will add to your paper to link to your supplementary material (potentially putting your paper over the original 10-page limit), we will allow your paper to expand to 8½ pages (including figures and tables) + 2 pages for references, leaving room for additional Springer content/formatting on the bottom half of page 11. Note that since Springer will re-set your paper with the formatting rules we specified, it is still extremely important that you strictly adhere to the guidelines (i.e., no spaces, no modified margins, no vertical spacing adjustments, no font adjustments, etc.). The program chairs reserve the right to reject papers that are over the 10½ -page limit in the final version, or to reject those that have modified formatting commands in the Springer templates.

All figures are printed in black and white. Colored figures remain in color in the online version. Please make sure that any colored figures are comprehensible in black and white. Springer does not support color in the text, tables, or equations.

Please ensure that Springer's format for bibliographical references is strictly enforced. 

Please make sure that if the same author appears on multiple papers their name appears in the same form on all papers and is consistent with the form used in the author list you submitted to CMT when you registered your paper. Please make sure the order of the authors on your paper is the same as is entered into CMT.

If you use LaTeX, please insert a line % index{Last Name, First Name} for every author of the paper, right after the author{} command. We will use these to create an author index in the proceedings. We need your help to make sure we parse authors' names into the last name and the first name correctly. This is particularly important for those authors with more than two words in their full names, making such parsing ambiguous.

The submission site will ask you to upload a single .zip file of your submission. Please zip all your files, including the digital copy of the signed copyright form, and name the .zip file using your paper submission ID (for example MLCN22-12.zip, where 12 is your paper ID).

Please include the following files in the .zip file:

•	If using LaTeX, include LaTeX2e files (*.tex) for the text and PS/EPS/JPG/PDF/PNG files for all figures and movies following the Embedding a video section below. Include your .bib file. Please use consistent names for your source files: paperXX.pdf, paperXX.tex, where XX is your paper ID;
•	If using Word, simply upload the Word file
•	Any additional style files and fonts you used, together with your source files that are not generally available at CTAN;
•	Final PDF file of the paper (for reference). Please do not include earlier versions.
•	RTF files if you are using a word-processing system other than LaTeX/TeX or Microsoft Word;
•	The LNCS copyright form must be signed by the corresponding author on behalf of all authors. The conference name, "MLCN 2022”, and the volume editors' names are already entered for you. Copyright forms must be signed in wet-ink. A digital signature is not acceptable. Please scan your signed copyright form and save it as a JPG or PDF file. 
Camera-ready Submission checklist:

•	I have included the final PDF of my camera-ready submission in my zip folder

•	(Latex user only) I have included %index{Last Name, First Name} for every author of the paper, right after the author{} command.
•	(Latex user only) I have included source files, including the .tex, .bib (if using BibTex), and figure files.
•	(Word user only) I have included my word file (.docx)
•	I have named my .ZIP file using the format: MLCN22-Num.zip, where Num is your paper ID.
